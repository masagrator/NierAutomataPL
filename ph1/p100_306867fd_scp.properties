M1010_S0050_G0040_300_a9s=This must have been quite a city once upon a time. Too bad vegetation's claimed most of it now...
M1010_S0060_G0000_001_a9s=So this is the Resistance Camp, huh?
M1010_S0060_G0010_001_a9s=We should probably go talk to their leader first thing.
M1010_S0060_G0020_001_ane=You're...
M1010_S0060_G0025_001_ane=Number Two...
M1010_S0060_G0030_001_a9s=Hmm? You know about 2B?
M1010_S0060_G0040_001_ane=Um... Yes, well, the Bunker told me to expect you.
M1010_S0060_G0050_001_ane=My name is Anemone.
M1010_S0060_G0060_001_ane=I'm the leader of the android Resistance that controls most of this territory.
M1010_S0060_G0070_001_ane=You must be the new scouts we heard about.
M1010_S0060_G0080_001_ane=Well, I'm sure my people will have plenty of information for you.
M1010_S0060_G0090_001_ane=Please, feel free to ask them anything you like.
M1010_S0060_G0100_001_ane=I expect you'll be dealing a lot with the weapons trader and the supply trader, so why don't you go say 'hi'?
M1010_S0060_G0110_001_ane=Also, there's this girl near the entrance wearing the head of a machine lifeform...
M1010_S0060_G0120_001_ane=She's a bit of an odd-ball, but she's really smart, so I'm sure she's got lots of useful information for you.
M1020_S0005_G0000_001_ane=Oh, hey, I actually have a request for you as well.
M1020_S0005_G0010_001_ane=There have been lots of reports of dangerous machines appearing in the desert recently.
M1020_S0005_G0020_001_ane=This is very unusual, so it may be indicative of something bigger.
M1020_S0005_G0030_001_ane=Now, I hear you YoRHa types are pretty good at examining things.
M1020_S0005_G0040_001_ane=You think you can look into this whole mess for me?
M1020_S0005_G0050_001_ane=Help her.
M1020_S0005_G0060_001_ane=Don't help her.
M1020_S0005_G0070_001_ane=Thanks\! I knew I could count on you\!
M1020_S0005_G0080_001_ane=I'll tell our allies in the desert that you're coming.
M1020_S0005_G0090_001_ane=Be careful out there, okay?
M1020_S0005_G0100_001_ane=I see. Alright, let me know if you change your mind.
M5920_S0100_G0000_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B. It is time for your regularly-scheduled contact.
M5920_S0100_G0010_001_a2b=This is 2B. Nothing to report.
M5920_S0100_G0020_001_op60=Good to hear. Say, how's the weather on Earth today? Good?
M5920_S0100_G0030_001_a2b=It's fine. Does that question have anything to do with our operation?
M5920_S0100_G0040_001_op60=Not really\! I just figured it might feel nice to have some good weather.
M5920_S0100_G0050_001_a2b=Feeling nice has no bearing on completing missions.
M5920_S0100_G0060_001_op60=Hee hee\! That is so like you, 2B.
M5920_S0100_G0070_001_op60=Anyway, talk to you later\!
M5920_S0100_G0320_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S. This is your regularly-scheduled contact.
M5920_S0100_G0330_001_a9s=This is 9S. Nothing to report. Weather's sure nice today, though\!
M5920_S0100_G0340_001_op210=Nothing to report, copy that.
M5920_S0100_G0350_001_op210=And...no need for a weather report. Operator 21O out.
M5920_S0100_G0360_001_a9s=Aw, you don't have to be so formal all the time, Operator.
M5920_S0100_G0370_001_a9s=Though I kinda like that about you.
M6090_S0010_G0015_300_kj=Newcomer, are you? Go talk to the commanding officer over there.
M6090_S0010_G0045_300_toolshop=You're with YoRHa, right? Well, you still need to talk to our commanding officer first. Even you guys gotta follow the rules.
M6090_S0010_G0125_300_resiman=Our leader Anemone is responsible for this camp. You should go say hi when you get a minute.
M6090_S0010_G0145_300_resiman=Heya. Haven't seen you around here before.
M6090_S0010_G0165_300_resiman=Oh, hey. Did you talk to our leader yet?
M6090_S0010_G0195_300_resiman=......
M6090_S0010_G0255_300_resiwoman=Anemone over there is the camp leader.
M6090_S0010_G0285_300_resiwoman=You're a YoRHa soldier, right? I've been expecting you. Have you met our fearless leader Anemone yet? You have, right? Or maybe not?
M6090_S0010_G0415_300_resiwoman=If you're going to inspect the camp, make sure you get permission first, okay?
M6090_S0010_G0435_300_resiwoman=Um, soooo...who are you?
M6090_S0010_G0455_300_resiwoman=Our leader's in the back.
M6090_S0010_G0485_300_resiman=Are you new here?
M6090_S0010_G0515_300_resiman=Make sure you're never taken into this first-aid room, okay? Stay safe out there\!
M6090_S0010_G0535_300_resiman=Hey, you\! You've got to speak to our leader Anemone before you do anything else. That's how things work around here.
M6090_S0010_G0555_300_resiwoman=You new here? Nice to meet you.
M6090_S0010_G0575_300_resiman=......
M6090_S0010_G0605_300_resiwoman=I think our leader Anemone is in the tent at the square.
M6090_S0010_G0625_300_resiwoman=I can't just tell any outsider that comes barging in here everything that's going on at this camp.
M6090_S0010_G0645_300_resiman=Hmm? Oh, a new YoRHa unit, eh?
M6090_S0010_G0665_300_resiman=Huh? Hey, you can't come this far without our leader's permission.
M6090_S0010_G0685_300_resiman=Sorry. You've got to talk to our leader first. Them's the rules.
M6090_S0010_G0705_300_resiman=The rules here are a lot stricter than the other camps. You have to get the leader's approval before you do anything.
M6090_S0010_G0735_300_resiman=Oh, our leader isn't here?
M6090_S0010_G0785_300_resiman=Hey, you can't loiter here without our leader's permission.
M6090_S0010_G0805_300_ys=Oh, a newcomer? You should you talk to our leader, Anemone.
M6090_S0010_G0835_300_bs=Oh, you're a YoRHa soldier? You should talk to our leader Anemone first.
M6090_S0091_G0001_300_hennawresi=Are you the new YoRHa soldiers? If so, you should go meet our leader.
