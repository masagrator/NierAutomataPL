M1020_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=This sand sure is slippery.
M1020_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Careful. We've got enemies approaching.

M1020_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=Yeah, I heard from the Resistance that they've been seeing this a lot lately.
M1020_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=Couldn't tell you why, though.

M1020_S0020_G0190_001_a2b=What's with the weird-looking outfits?
M1020_S0020_G0200_001_a9s=I've seen that sort of thing when I was going through some old data. It looks like what humans used to wear long ago.
M1020_S0020_G0210_001_a9s=Certain human collectives used to use face paint like that, too.

M1020_S0020_G0270_001_a9s=2B, it's fine. Their speech doesn't mean anything.
M1020_S0020_G0280_001_a9s=They're just emitting words at random.
M1020_S0020_G0290_001_a9s=If they wanted help, why would they be attacking us?
M1020_S0020_G0300_001_a2b=...Yeah.
