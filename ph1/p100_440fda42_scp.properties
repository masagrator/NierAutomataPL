M0010_S0210_G0000_001_a9s=You're 2B, right?
M0010_S0210_G0010_001_a9s=My name's 9S. I'm here to provide support.
M0010_S0210_G0020_001_a2b=Copy that.
M0010_S0210_G0030_001_a9s=Soooo, was that big ol' buzzsaw the Goliath you came here to take out?
M0010_S0210_G0040_001_a2b=No. Just another defensive system.
M0010_S0210_G0050_001_a9s=Oh. Well, uh...I guess we have to find the target then, huh?
M0010_S0210_G0060_001_a9s=I've got a flight unit, so I'll take a look around the perimeter.
M0010_S0210_G0070_001_a2b=All right. I'll work my way inside from the ground.
