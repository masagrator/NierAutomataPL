M1040_S0030_G0000_001_a2b=They all have white flags...
M1040_S0030_G0000_300_a9s=I know you're not thrilled about this, 2B, but why don't we hear what these machines have to say? I'm curious what their intentions are.
M1040_S0030_G0005_300_a9s=Alert\: Current intel insufficient for Command. Suggest investigating machine lifeform settlement.
M1040_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=Looks like they really don't want to fight.
M1040_S0030_G0010_300_a2b=9S, let's go back and get some data from the machines.
M1040_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=There's something weird about this village...
M1040_S0030_G0080_001_a9s=We should go back and look around some more.
M1040_S0030_G0090_001_pascal=Hello.
M1040_S0030_G0100_001_pascal=Before we begin, there's something you must understand...
M1040_S0030_G0110_001_pascal=We are not your enemies.
M1040_S0030_G0120_001_a9s=2B, we can't trust anything the machines say\!
M1040_S0030_G0130_001_pascal=I understand that you see us as the enemy, but...
M1040_S0030_G0140_001_pascal=Well, anyway. My name is Pascal. I'm the leader of this village.
M1040_S0030_G0150_001_pascal=Those who reside here desire nothing more than to live a peaceful existence.
M1040_S0030_G0160_001_pascal=Look around for yourself. You'll see that it's true.
M1040_S0030_G0170_001_pascal=Well? What do you think?
M1040_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=Gah\! He just started transmitting to us directly...
M1040_S0030_G0190_001_pascal=Now do you believe we're not a threat?
M1040_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=Your mouth can say anything it wants...
M1040_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=But you still don't have a heart.
M1040_S0030_G0220_001_pascal=I suppose that's...technically accurate.
M1040_S0030_G0230_001_pascal=Yes, well, you're free to visit our village whenever you like.
M1040_S0030_G0240_001_pascal=After all, the only way to understand someone is to get to know them. Isn't that right?
M1040_S0030_G0250_001_a2b=Fair enough.
M1040_S0031_G0000_001_pascal=You know, we already have something of a relationship with you androids.
M1040_S0031_G0010_001_pascal=In fact, I'm hoping you can take this to Anemone in the Resistance camp.
M1040_S0031_G0020_001_a9s=What is it?
M1040_S0031_G0030_001_pascal=It's a fuel filter that she requested.
M1040_S0031_G0040_001_pascal=If you take it to her, it should make it clear that we're a peaceful group.
M1040_S0031_G0050_001_a2b=All right.
M1040_S0031_G0060_001_a9s=Say, Anemone? I've got a package for you from a machine called Pascal.
M1040_S0031_G0070_001_ane=...A fuel filter? Ah, perfect timing—we were running low.
M1040_S0031_G0080_001_ane=Wait, you met Pascal?
M1040_S0031_G0090_001_a9s=Sure did. So you've been consorting with machines, huh?
M1040_S0031_G0100_001_ane=Just the ones in the village. They're totally harmless, and they also have the means to construct intricate devices that we can't.
M1040_S0031_G0110_001_ane=In exchange, we provide them with oil and other materials. I guess you'd call it a form of commerce.
M1040_S0031_G0120_001_a9s=I see...
M1040_S0031_G0130_001_ane=Anyway, if you're headed back there, please take this high-viscosity oil to Pascal.
M1040_S0031_G0140_001_ane=If you see Pascal, please give him that high-viscosity oil.
M1040_S0031_G0150_001_ane=Thanks for all you've been doing for us late—oh\!\nI nearly forgot.
M1040_S0031_G0160_001_ane=I readied a room here for YoRHa androids.
M1040_S0031_G0170_001_ane=Feel free to make use of it whenever you like.
M1040_S0031_G0180_001_pascal=Oh, you brought me some high-viscosity oil\!
M1040_S0031_G0190_001_pascal=Anemone is just so kind and understanding.
M1040_S0031_G0200_001_pascal=If only all androids and machines could live together in peace like this...
M1040_S0031_G0210_001_a9s=Never gonna happen.
M1040_S0031_G0220_001_pascal=I guess not... I'd appreciate it if you could help out some of the other machines as well, though.
M5920_S0090_G0130_001_human=The Council of Humanity has a message for all of our brave androids fighting on the surface.
M5920_S0090_G0140_001_human=It has been several millennia since the aliens—and their advance force, the machine lifeforms—attacked us.
M5920_S0090_G0150_001_human=Millennia since mankind was forced to evacuate to the surface of the moon.
M5920_S0090_G0160_001_human=But thanks to your continued struggle, we have been able to survive.
M5920_S0090_G0170_001_human=You, our android soldiers, are the last hope of humanity.
M5920_S0090_G0180_001_human=We look forward to your continued success in combat.
M5920_S0090_G0190_001_human=Glory to mankind.
M5920_S0100_G0080_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B...\nTime for your regularly-scheduled contact...
M5920_S0100_G0090_001_a2b=2B here. What's wrong?
M5920_S0100_G0100_001_op60=Oh, there's this operator I kind of liked, but when I asked her out, she turned me down.
M5920_S0100_G0110_001_op60=Honestly, 2B? I don't know how I'm supposed to go on living.
M5920_S0100_G0120_001_a2b=I am definitely not the person to discuss this with.
M5920_S0100_G0130_001_op60=I don't think I can stand spending one more day in this Bunker...
M5920_S0100_G0140_001_a2b=You leaving would be bad for me. It would affect mission efficiency.
M5920_S0100_G0150_001_op60=A-Are you saying you need me, 2B?
M5920_S0100_G0160_001_a2b=All model-B combat units require the assistance of an operator.
M5920_S0100_G0170_001_a2b=So...
M5920_S0100_G0180_001_op60=2B...
M5920_S0100_G0190_001_a2b=That's all. Closing this channel.
M5920_S0100_G0380_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S. This is your regularly-scheduled contact.
M5920_S0100_G0390_001_op210=I have something important to discuss with you today.
M5920_S0100_G0400_001_a9s=What is it?
M5920_S0100_G0410_001_op210=Our maintenance team filed a complaint about how you treat your flight unit.
M5920_S0100_G0420_001_op210=They requested that you cease making unauthorized modifications.
M5920_S0100_G0430_001_a9s=Well, I kind of had to. There's so much excess data sent to me from the satellite, it's delaying aim correction.
M5920_S0100_G0440_001_op210=If you have a rebuttal, you need to discuss it with maintenance. Fight it out if you must.
M5920_S0100_G0450_001_op210=Operator 21O out.
M5920_S0100_G0460_001_a9s=Geez. My operator's more prone to violence than I thought.
