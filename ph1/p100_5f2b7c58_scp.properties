M0010_S0700_G0031_101_a2b=Is that...?
M0010_S0700_G0032_101_a9s=You mean the birds?
M0010_S0700_G0033_101_a9s=Yeah, there's more plants and animals here than there used to be. Probably because the environment's changed.
M0010_S0700_G0040_101_a2b=I surveyed the entire factory, but couldn't find anything resembling our target.
M0010_S0700_G0060_101_a9s=Maybe they...I dunno. Moved it somewhere?
M0010_S0700_G0061_101_a9s=There should be another facility across that bridge.
M0010_S0700_G0062_101_a9s=It's a bit of a hike, but should we check it out?
M0010_S0700_G0070_101_a9s=It's not like Command to get a location wrong. I guess even they get bad intel from time to time, huh?
M0010_S0700_G0080_101_a2b=Hmm.
M0010_S0700_G0090_101_a2b=I wouldn't bet on that.
