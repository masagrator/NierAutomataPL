M1010_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=Hey, 2B. Why do you think they sent a combat model like you to a recon job?
M1010_S0040_G0010_001_a9s=If all they want is intel, we Scanner models are built for that kind of thing.
M1010_S0040_G0020_001_a2b=Orders are orders.
M1010_S0040_G0030_001_a9s=All right, all right.
M1010_S0040_G0031_001_op60=2B, you're going to have some new weaponry installed from here on out.
M1010_S0040_G0032_001_op60=I'll put up instructions for you. Make sure to commit them to memory\!
M1010_S0040_G0033_001_a2b=Roger.
M1010_S0040_G0040_001_op60=Bunker to 2B, come in.
M1010_S0040_G0050_001_op60=I've set a landing point for your flight units.
M1010_S0040_G0060_001_op60=You'll be touching down quite a ways from the Resistance camp, unfortunately.
M1010_S0040_G0070_001_op60=Sorry for the trouble, but we can't risk the enemy discovering their position.
M1010_S0040_G0080_001_a2b=Understood.
M1010_S0040_G0090_001_op60=Good luck down there\!
