M0010_S0220_G0110_101_a9s=You know, ma'am, I'm glad you're here.
M0010_S0220_G0120_101_a2b=Why?
M0010_S0220_G0130_101_a9s=Scanners like me mostly work alone. Scouting out enemy lines and all that?
M0010_S0220_G0140_101_a9s=I don't usually get a partner. It's kind of fun\!
M0010_S0220_G0150_101_a2b=...Emotions are prohibited.
M0010_S0220_G0160_101_a9s=S-sorry, ma'am\!
M0010_S0220_G0170_101_a2b=And another thing...
M0010_S0220_G0180_101_a2b=Stop calling me "ma'am".
M0010_S0220_G0190_101_a9s=Huh?
M0010_S0220_G0200_101_a2b=It's unnecessary.
M0010_S0220_G0210_101_a9s=All right, then. 2B it is\!
M0010_S0220_G0220_101_a2b=This place sure is big.
M0010_S0220_G0230_101_a9s=I guess humans used to use it as a weapons factory.
M0010_S0220_G0240_101_a9s=But now it's just crawling with machines.
M0010_S0220_G0250_101_a9s=The enemy seems to have repurposed the facility to increase their overall machine production.
M0010_S0220_G0260_101_a2b=So if we don't destroy it, they'll just keep coming.
M0010_S0220_G0266_101_a2b=...What?
M0010_S0220_G0267_101_a9s=It's just accessing random nonsensical data from the old world.
M0010_S0220_G0268_101_a9s=There's no actual meaning behind anything machines do.
