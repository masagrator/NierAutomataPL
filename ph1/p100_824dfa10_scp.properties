M1030_S0010_G0111_001_op210=Operator to 9S.
M1030_S0010_G0112_001_a9s=This is 9S. Go ahead.
M1030_S0010_G0113_001_op210=I have an incoming message for 2B and 9S from the Commander.
M1030_S0010_G0120_001_op210=Initiating playback.
M1030_S0010_G0130_001_cmd=2B? 9S? We've lost contact with several YoRHa units that were on their way to the surface.
M1030_S0010_G0140_001_cmd=Their black boxes are online, so we presume they're still alive.
M1030_S0010_G0150_001_cmd=We've tracked the location of their signals,
M1030_S0010_G0160_001_cmd=so I need all YoRHa units on the surface to head over and investigate.
M1030_S0010_G0170_001_op210=End transmission.
M1030_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=Hmm. I heard something about that back at the Resistance camp.
M1030_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=Target location confirmed.
M1030_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=I'm worried about the other androids...
M1030_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=We should probably check this out as soon as possible.
M1030_S0015_G0000_001_ane=Ah, it's you.
M1030_S0015_G0010_001_ane=I heard from Jackass about your encounter in the desert. Good work.
M1030_S0015_G0020_001_ane=We don't have much to offer in thanks, but I've readied a room for you here.
M1030_S0015_G0030_001_a2b=Oh?
M1030_S0015_G0040_001_ane=It's the least we can do. Feel free to use it however you like.
M1030_S0015_G0050_001_a9s=Hey, thanks\!
