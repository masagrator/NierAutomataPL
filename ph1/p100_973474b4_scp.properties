M1010_S0030_G0000_001_a2b=9S...
M1010_S0030_G0000_300_a9s=The hangar's up ahead. Let's go.
M1010_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=The Commander's put me in charge of your maintenance, ma'am.
M1010_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=That means I'll be performing regular checks on you from now on.
M1010_S0030_G0020_300_a9s=Are you carrying enough supplies on you? If not, you can always use the terminal in your room to replenish them.
M1010_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=...I see.
M1010_S0030_G0030_300_a9s=Come to think of it, do we have enough supplies?
M1010_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=Oh, don't worry. We 9S models are the best around, you know.
M1010_S0030_G0040_300_a2b=What say we go stock up over there?
M1010_S0030_G0050_001_a9s=Though I suppose we're not exactly known for our modesty.
M1010_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=......
M1010_S0030_G0060_300_a9s=This here's my room. Feel free to swing by whenever you want\!
M1010_S0030_G0061_001_a2b=...9S.
M1010_S0030_G0062_001_a9s=Hm? What is it, ma'am?
M1010_S0030_G0063_001_a2b=Stop calling me "ma'am."
M1010_S0030_G0064_001_a9s=Huh?
M1010_S0030_G0065_001_a2b=There's no need to be so formal.
M1010_S0030_G0066_001_a9s=A-All right. If you say so.
M1010_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=Oh, I almost forgot—
M1010_S0030_G0070_300_a9s=Not that there's much to do here...
M1010_S0030_G0080_001_a9s=The Commander was calling for you.
M1010_S0030_G0080_300_a2b=Is there something you forgot?
M1010_S0030_G0085_001_a9s=We'd better go see what's up, ma—er, 2B\!
M1010_S0030_G0090_001_cmd=Ah, 2B.
M1010_S0030_G0100_001_cmd=Maintenance finished?
M1010_S0030_G0110_001_a2b=Yes, Commander.
M1010_S0030_G0120_001_cmd=You detonated your black box in order to defeat the enemy.
M1010_S0030_G0130_001_cmd=Bold, but risky. Try not to be so reckless next time.
M1010_S0030_G0140_001_a2b=Understood.
M1010_S0030_G0150_001_cmd=I know you're fresh out of maintenance, but I have another mission for you.
M1010_S0030_G0160_001_cmd=I need you to head to the surface, rendezvous with the Resistance, and do some recon.
M1010_S0030_G0170_001_a9s=Doesn't YoRHa have a dedicated Resistance contact already?
M1010_S0030_G0180_001_cmd=We haven't been able to get in touch with them.
M1010_S0030_G0190_001_cmd=So we'll need you to look into that as well.
M1010_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=Understood.
M1010_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=The surface? That means we'll be getting flight units, huh?
M1010_S0030_G0220_001_a9s=Better head for the hangar\!
M1010_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=Heh. Usually we can't get NEAR flight units. They're way too expensive for us grunts.
M1010_S0030_G0240_001_a9s=Too bad they can't mass-produce these things yet...
M5920_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=You need to be near an access point to save your data.
M5920_S0040_G0010_001_a9s=You can see access points on the close-range map. Be sure to save often\!
