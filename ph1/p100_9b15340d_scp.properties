M1040_S0033_G0000_001_a9s=What's that noise?
M1040_S0033_G0010_011_op60=2B, this is an emergency transmission from the Bunker\!
M1040_S0033_G0020_011_op60=We're reading a Goliath-class enemy inside the city ruins\!
M1040_S0033_G0030_011_op60=And it looks like there are a ton of other machines there with it\!
M1040_S0033_G0040_011_op60=All YoRHa units should proceed and engage immediately\!
M1040_S0033_G0050_021_op210=Operator to 9S. Emergency transmission incoming.
M1040_S0033_G0060_021_op210=We've detected a Goliath-class enemy inside the city ruins.
M1040_S0033_G0070_021_op210=It seems to be accompanied by a large number of machine lifeforms.
M1040_S0033_G0080_021_op210=All YoRHa members are ordered to engage at once.
M1040_S0033_G0090_001_a9s=A Goliath\!?
M1040_S0033_G0100_001_a9s=This WAS a trap\! I knew it\!
M1040_S0033_G0110_001_pascal=...I promise you, we were not aware of this information.
M1040_S0033_G0120_001_pascal=I realize the odds of you believing me are strikingly low...
M1040_S0033_G0130_001_pascal=But I hope you will nonetheless.
M1040_S0033_G0140_001_a2b=We'll sort it out later. Let's go.
M1040_S0033_G0142_001_op210=Operator 21O here. Do you read me?
M1040_S0033_G0150_021_op210=Operator to 9S. I have bad news and I have good news.
M1040_S0033_G0160_021_op210=Bad firstâ€”we've confirmed the presence of two Goliath-class heavy-weapon enemies.
M1040_S0033_G0170_021_a9s=TWO of them\!?
M1040_S0033_G0180_021_op210=Now the good news.
M1040_S0033_G0190_021_op210=We've used your previous Goliath combat data to analyze the enemy...
M1040_S0033_G0200_021_op210=And it seems we have identified a weakness.
M1040_S0033_G0210_021_op210=Command has modified a firing unit based on this new intel.
M1040_S0033_G0220_021_op210=It's been installed on a pair of flight units that are heading your way.
M1040_S0033_G0230_021_a9s=That's YoRHa R&D for you\!
M1040_S0033_G0240_021_op210=Check your map data. Operator out.
M1040_S0033_G0250_021_a9s=Thanks, Operator\!
M1040_S0033_G0260_001_a9s=2B\! Command is deploying new flight units for us\!
M1040_S0033_G0270_001_a9s=They just sent the coordinates, so let's get going.
M1040_S0033_G0280_001_a2b=On it.
M1040_S0035_G0000_001_a9s=We probably shouldn't get near that guy's feet...
M1040_S0035_G0010_001_a9s=Yeah, no. Let's find another route.
M1040_S0035_G0020_001_a9s=The flight units should be on the roof of that building up ahead.
M1040_S0035_G0021_001_a9s=It'll be dangerous, but we're not going anywhere unless we pass through that Goliath's legs.
M1040_S0035_G0030_001_a9s=We should be careful.
M1040_S0038_G0000_001_a9s=Aaaah\!
M1040_S0038_G0010_001_a2b=Damn it\!
M1040_S0038_G0020_001_a9s=2B\!
M1040_S0038_G0030_001_a9s=Displaying data on central wiring hub\!
M1040_S0038_G0040_001_a9s=Let's get to those flight units while we can\!
M1040_S0040_G0000_011_op60=Be careful\! The skies are packed with anti-air weapons.
M1040_S0040_G0000_300_ysA=Ah\!
M1040_S0040_G0010_011_op60=Make sure to approach at low altitude.
M1040_S0040_G0010_300_ysA=You beat that thing with surface-based gear? That's a surprise\!
M1040_S0040_G0020_011_a2b=Copy that.
M1040_S0040_G0020_300_ysA=Thanks for the backup.
M1040_S0040_G0030_021_op210=Enemy anti-air defenses are on patrol at higher altitudes.
M1040_S0040_G0030_300_ysB=You guys are amazing...
M1040_S0040_G0040_021_op210=A low-altitude approach is recommended.
M1040_S0040_G0050_021_a9s=Got it, thanks\!
M1040_S0040_G0050_300_ysB=Thanks. We owe you one.
M1040_S0040_G0060_300_pod042=Proposal\: Confirm current destination.
M1040_S0040_G0061_300_pod042=Alert\: Leaving the operational area has resulted in significant allied casualties.
