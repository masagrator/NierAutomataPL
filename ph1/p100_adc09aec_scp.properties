M1030_S0400_G0250_001_a2b=What's that?
M1030_S0400_G0260_001_a9s=Oh, right. You wouldn't have seen that before.
M1030_S0400_G0270_001_a9s=They're sending supplies up from Earth to the moon and the Bunker.
M1030_S0400_G0280_001_a9s=There are no spare parts or fuel in space, after all.
M1030_S0400_G0290_001_a2b=Huh.
M1030_S0400_G0300_001_a2b=So why don't the machines—or the aliens who created them—attack the Bunker directly?
M1030_S0400_G0310_001_a2b=They originally came here from outer space, right?
M1030_S0400_G0320_001_a9s=Well, there are a few theories about that...
M1030_S0400_G0330_001_a9s=But no one knows for sure.
M1030_S0400_G0340_001_a9s=Hard to tell what an alien is thinking, you know?
