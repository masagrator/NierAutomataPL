M1080_S0070_G0180_101_rbot9s=Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\! 2B\!
M1080_S0070_G0190_101_rbot9s=It's me\! 9S\!
M1080_S0070_G0200_101_a2b=...9S\!?
M1080_S0070_G0210_101_a9s=I hacked into this machine from the Bunker. I'm controlling it\!
M1080_S0070_G0220_101_a9s=I'm gonna break into this factory's systems and get you outta here\!
M1080_S0070_G0230_101_a2b=Appreciated.
M1080_S0075_G0000_101_pod153=Pod 153\: Hacking into factory system.
M1080_S0080_G0110_300_a9s=Uh oh... I'd better get to 2B fast\!
M1080_S0080_G0120_300_a9s=Damn it\! Maybe I should've taken over something with a little more power...
M1080_S0080_G0150_300_a9s=Look at all these broken machines...
M1080_S0080_G0160_300_a9s=A few still look usable. Better send these coordinates to the Bunker, just in case.
M1080_S0080_G0300_300_a9s=All right. If I can hack this elevator and get it running, I can get 2B and everyone else out of here\!
