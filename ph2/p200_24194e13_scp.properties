M1050_S0115_S0000_201_eve=Why must we read all of these books, brother?
M1050_S0115_S0010_201_adam=Knowledge expands horizons and enriches existence.
M1050_S0115_S0020_201_eve=But can't we just transfer all this data over instantly?
M1050_S0115_S0030_201_adam=Into your head, perhaps. But not to your heart.
M1050_S0115_S0040_201_eve=Hmm. I guess.
M1050_S0115_S0050_201_eve=......
M1050_S0115_S0060_201_eve=Hey, so...
M1050_S0115_S0070_201_adam=Yes?
M1050_S0115_S0080_201_eve=My name? Eve? This book says it's a woman's name.
M1050_S0115_S0090_201_eve=Shouldn't we be called Cain and Abel or something instead?
M1050_S0115_S0100_201_adam=Humans wouldn't change names so easily.
M1050_S0115_S0110_201_adam=Besides, you should be proud of the name Eve.
M1050_S0115_S0120_201_eve=Huh...
M1050_S0115_S0130_201_eve=Well, if that's what you think, then I'm fine with it.
M1050_S0115_S0140_201_adam=Glad to hear it.
M1050_S0115_S0150_201_eve=Ummm...
M1050_S0115_S0160_201_adam=Is there something else?
M1050_S0115_S0170_201_eve=After we're done reading, can we go out and play?
M1050_S0115_S0180_201_eve=I'm sure it'll be TONS of fun\!
M1050_S0115_S0190_201_adam=All right. But only after we're finished.
M1050_S0115_S0200_201_eve=You mean it\!?
M1050_S0115_S0210_201_eve=Then I'm gonna try extra hard to finish this\!
M1050_S0115_S0220_201_eve=Extra EXTRA hard\!
M1050_S0115_S0230_201_adam=You do that.
