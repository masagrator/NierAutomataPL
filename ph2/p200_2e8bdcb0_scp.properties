M1040_S0545_S0000_001_cmd=YoRHa, this is your Commander.
M1040_S0545_S0001_001_a2b=What is this?
M1040_S0545_S0002_001_pod042=Analysis\: It is a cave-in caused by the collapse of an open space underground.
M1040_S0545_S0003_001_a9s=Why is there such a huge cavern beneath the city?
M1040_S0545_S0010_001_cmd=For the first time in centuries, we've intercepted a signal belonging to the aliens.
M1040_S0545_S0020_001_cmd=These are the creatures that are in direct command of the machine lifeforms on this planet.
M1040_S0545_S0030_001_cmd=If we can destroy them, we can end this long and arduous war once and for all\!
M1040_S0545_S0040_001_cmd=Our intel team is hard at work attempting to analyze the source of the signal, but we're not there yet.
M1040_S0545_S0050_001_cmd=We need more data.
M1040_S0545_S0060_001_cmd=All YoRHa units are hereby ordered to prioritize data collection above all else.
M1040_S0545_S0070_001_cmd=We can't let this chance slip through our fingers\!
M1040_S0545_S0080_001_cmd=...Glory to mankind.
M1040_S0545_S0090_300_a9s=That's a weird-looking enemy.
M1040_S0550_G0001_001_a9s=I used Command's data to determine the signal's source and marked it on the map.
M1040_S0550_G0010_001_a9s=But it seems to be underground. Like, way underground.
M1040_S0550_G0020_001_a2b=Guess we'll see once we get there.
M1040_S0550_G0021_001_a2b=...If we're lucky.
M1040_S0550_G0030_001_a9s=You're not much for plans, are you, 2B?
M1040_S0550_G0120_300_a9s=2B, we picked up the signal under the caved-in area.\nLet's go check it out.
M1040_S0550_G0130_300_pod042=Analysis\: Strong software locks detected. Access impossible.
