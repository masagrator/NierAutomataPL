M1050_S0195_S0134_201_n02=You will go no further\!
M1050_S0195_S0135_201_n02=We will protect the king with our very lives\!
M1050_S0195_S0136_201_n02=Don't give them a single inch\!
M1050_S0195_S0137_201_n02=All hail the king\!
M1050_S0195_S0138_201_n02=This is our beloved nation\!
M1050_S0210_G0000_001_a9s=2B\! That's...an android\!
M1050_S0210_G0010_001_a9s=A YoRHa-type android\!
M1050_S0210_G0020_011_pod042=Alert\: This unit is currently wanted by YoRHa. Annihilation recommended.
M1050_S0210_G0030_021_pod153=Alert\: This unit is currently wanted by YoRHa. Annihilation recommended.
M1050_S0210_G0040_001_a9s=Annihilation? But why\!?
M1050_S0210_G0050_001_a2b=Let's go, 9S.
M1050_S0210_G0060_001_a9s=2B\!
M1050_S0210_G0070_001_a2=
M1050_S0210_G0080_001_cmd=Bunker to 2B and 9S.
M1050_S0210_G0090_001_cmd=We've picked up a signal from the black box of a fugitive known as A2.
M1050_S0210_G0100_001_cmd=What you see in front of you...is your enemy.
M1050_S0210_G0110_001_a2b=
M1050_S0210_G0120_001_a9s=But she'sâ€”
M1050_S0210_G0130_001_cmd=She deserted us. She's destroyed multiple pursuit androids.
M1050_S0210_G0140_001_cmd=Now kill her before she kills you\!
M1050_S0230_G0000_001_a9s=Operator, this is 9S. Patch me through to the Commander.
M1050_S0230_G0001_001_a9s=Let's go after her, 2B\!
M1050_S0230_G0003_001_a2b=She's gone...
M1050_S0230_G0010_001_op210=Roger that, 9S.
M1050_S0230_G0020_001_a9s=I'm sorry, Commander. We failed to defeat the fugitive.
M1050_S0230_G0020_300__pod042=Proposal\: Pursue the deserter A2.
M1050_S0230_G0030_001_cmd=I see.
M1050_S0230_G0030_300_a9s=Damn\! She got away.
M1050_S0230_G0040_001_cmd=Well, at least you're both safe.
M1050_S0230_G0050_001_cmd=That's an incredibly powerful unit you just faced.
M1050_S0230_G0050_300_a9s=That must be the gate Pascal opened for us.
M1050_S0230_G0060_001_cmd=You should probably keep your distance in the future.
M1050_S0230_G0060_300_n02=We have been expecting you.
M1050_S0230_G0070_001_a9s=Commander, why did A2 desert the force?
M1050_S0230_G0070_300_n02=Pascal told us about you.
M1050_S0230_G0080_001_cmd=......
M1050_S0230_G0080_300_n02=We will open the gate.
M1050_S0230_G0090_001_cmd=I'm afraid that's classified.
M1050_S0230_G0090_300_n02=Please pass through.
M1050_S0230_G0100_001_a9s=Oh? Huh.
M1050_S0230_G0100_300_n02=We will continue to stand guard.
M1050_S0230_G0110_001_a9s=...2B.
M1050_S0230_G0120_001_a2b=Yeah?
M1050_S0230_G0130_001_a9s=Let's go ask Pascal about A2.
M1050_S0230_G0140_001_a9s=He might know something.
M1050_S0230_G0150_001_a2b=All right.
M1050_S0230_G0160_001_a9s=Um, Pascal? This is 9S.
M1050_S0230_G0170_001_pascal=Oh\! You survived\! How wonderful.
M1050_S0230_G0180_001_a9s=Yeah, we're fine. But there's something we want to ask you about.
M1050_S0230_G0190_001_pascal=Of course\! Anything.
M1050_S0230_G0200_001_a9s=Actually, it needs to be in person.
M1050_S0230_G0210_001_pascal=Hmm. Understood.
M1050_S0230_G0220_001_pascal=I'll open the gate we built to deter enemy invaders.
M1050_S0230_G0230_001_pascal=You'll be able to reach the village through there.
