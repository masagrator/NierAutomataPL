M1060_S0070_G0000_001_a2b=Is that...a machine?
M1060_S0070_G0010_001_a9s=It's freakin' HUGE...
M1060_S0070_G0020_001_a9s=Crap\! It's blocking close-range attacks with EMP blasts.
M1060_S0070_G0030_001_a9s=We've got to find another way to damage it.
M1060_S0070_G0040_011_op60=2B, Command is attempting to launch a satellite laser strike on your target\!
M1060_S0070_G0050_011_op60=But the enemy's electromagnetic camouflage is making it impossible to aim.
M1060_S0070_G0060_011_op60=We need you to find the emitter and take it out\!
M1060_S0070_G0070_011_a2b=Oh, is that all?
M1060_S0070_G0080_011_op60=I know, I know\! But it's the only way\!
M1060_S0070_G0131_011_pod042=EMP generator target confirmed. Marking on map.
M1060_S0070_G0132_011_pod042=Proposal\: Destroy the generator quickly.
M1060_S0070_G0140_011_pod042=Enemy data obtained from Command.
M1060_S0070_G0150_011_a2b=Go ahead.
M1060_S0070_G0160_011_pod042=The only known record of this machine lifeform is a lone sighting 320 years ago.
M1060_S0070_G0170_011_pod042=Upon reaching land, the unit unleashed a devastating electromagnetic wave attack.
M1060_S0070_G0180_011_pod042=All Resistance fighters in the vicinity were annihilated.
M1060_S0070_G0190_011_a2b=So basically, if this thing reaches land, we're screwed.
M1060_S0070_G0200_011_pod042=Affirmative.
M1060_S0070_G0210_011_op60=Electromagnetic interference eliminated\!
M1060_S0070_G0220_011_op60=Preparing for satellite laser strike\!
