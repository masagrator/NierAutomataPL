M1060_S0005_G0000_001_pascal=I was surprised you wished to speak with me personally. Whatever is the matter?
M1060_S0005_G0010_001_a9s=It'll be faster if you just take a look at this recording.
M1060_S0005_G0020_001_sele=Transfer data.
M1060_S0005_G0030_001_sele=Don't transfer.
M1060_S0005_G0040_001_pascal=...I see.
M1060_S0005_G0050_001_pascal=Information about this A2 android is indeed contained within our archives.
M1060_S0005_G0060_001_pascal=We all understand her to be rather dangerous.
M1060_S0005_G0070_001_pascal=However, she's never visited our village in person.
M1060_S0005_G0080_001_pascal=My apologies. That's all the information I have.
M1060_S0005_G0090_001_a9s=I see... All right, thanks.
M1060_S0005_G0170_001_a2b=Let's stay sharp and head back to the Resistance camp.
M1060_S0005_G0180_001_a2b=We should run a check on our consciousness data and resupply.
