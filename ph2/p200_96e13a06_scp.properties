M1060_S0005_G0100_001_a2b=9S, why did you ask Pascal about A2?
M1060_S0005_G0110_001_a9s=Huh?
M1060_S0005_G0120_001_a2b=It's not recommended to interface with machines without consulting Command.
M1060_S0005_G0130_001_a9s=Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
M1060_S0005_G0140_001_a2b=Though I suppose such intense curiosity can be admirable... In its own way.
M1060_S0005_G0150_001_a9s=Heh.
M1060_S0005_G0160_001_a9s=Thanks, 2B.
M1060_S0005_G0161_001_a2b=Still, machines are the enemy. Don't forget it.
M1060_S0010_G0000_001_ane=Oh, 2B\! Your timing is impeccable.
M1060_S0010_G0010_001_ane=Our android forces currently have a carrier deployed in the Pacific Ocean.
M1060_S0010_G0020_001_ane=It should be back here to resupply before too long.
M1060_S0010_G0030_001_ane=The Resistance is assisting with the mission...
M1060_S0010_G0040_001_ane=So I'd like to ask you to run a little guard duty.
M1060_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Seriously?
M1060_S0010_G0060_001_ane=Dead serious. There's a stockpile of missiles down at the shoreline that needs to be loaded on the carrier.
M1060_S0010_G0070_001_ane=And with all the machine activity lately, we need to stay on our toes.
M1060_S0010_G0080_001_ane=Of course, if you're already working on something for YoRHa, I don't mind if that takes priority.
M1060_S0010_G0090_001_ane=Anyway, thanks in advance.
M5920_S0100_G0200_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B. It is time for your regularly-scheduled contact.
M5920_S0100_G0210_001_a2b=This is 2B. Nothing to report.
M5920_S0100_G0220_001_op60=Listen, 2B. I was looking at images of flowers today and—
M5920_S0100_G0230_001_a2b=Flowers?
M5920_S0100_G0240_001_op60=Yeah. There wasn't much left in the Bunker's records, but I found one called a lunar tear.
M5920_S0100_G0250_001_op60=I bet you'd look really nice if you put one of those in your hair, 2B. It'd suit your stylish looks\!
M5920_S0100_G0260_001_a2b=Don't need it.
M5920_S0100_G0270_001_op60=Aw, don't be a stick in the mud. What kind of girl doesn't want to look good sometimes?
M5920_S0100_G0280_001_op60=I'll let you know if I find anything else cute, okay?
M5920_S0100_G0290_001_a2b=I don't need to hear about—
M5920_S0100_G0300_001_op60=Operator 6O out.
M5920_S0100_G0310_001_a2b=......
M5920_S0100_G0470_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S. This is your regularly-scheduled contact.
M5920_S0100_G0480_001_a9s=Yeah, yeah. No problems here.
M5920_S0100_G0490_001_op210=Copy that. I also need to inform you that the Commander offers her personal praise for your recent achievements.
M5920_S0100_G0500_001_op210=As a direct result, we are currently considering boosting production of your model.
M5920_S0100_G0510_001_a9s=Really? I'm happy to hear it.
M5920_S0100_G0520_001_a9s=I couldn't have done it without your support, Operator. You're always so cool under fire, not to mention beautiful and—
M5920_S0100_G0530_001_op210=Flattery is unnecessary.
M5920_S0100_G0540_001_op210=Operator 21O out.
M5920_S0100_G0550_001_a9s=I really meant it though...
