M1080_S0080_G0080_201_a9s=Nice.
M1080_S0080_G0090_201_a9s=Now I just have to unlock the door where 2B is...
M1080_S0080_G0091_201_a9s=That machine looks a lot tougher than this one...
M1080_S0080_G0092_201_a9s=I should hack it and take control of it now while it's not suspecting anything.
M1080_S0080_G0100_300_a9s=If I want to reach 2B...I'll need to reach the factory's lower level first.
M1080_S0080_G0110_300_a9s=Uh oh... I'd better get to 2B fast\!
M1080_S0080_G0120_300_a9s=Damn it\! Maybe I should've taken over something with a little more power...
M1080_S0080_G0150_300_a9s=Look at all these broken machines...
M1080_S0080_G0160_300_a9s=A few still look usable. Better send these coordinates to the Bunker, just in case.
M1080_S0080_G0200_300_n02=Stop\!
M1080_S0080_G0210_300_n02=We shall become gods\!
M1080_S0080_G0220_300_n02=What are you thinking\!? Have your circuits failed you\!?
M1080_S0080_G0230_300_n02=We shall become gods\! We shall become gods\! We shall become gods\!
M1080_S0080_G0240_300_n02=What happened to all of you?
