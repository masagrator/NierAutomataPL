M1090_S0230_G0000_001_a9s=Damn it\! They're here too\!
M1090_S0230_G0010_001_pascal=9S\!
M1090_S0230_G0020_001_pascal=It seems the machines on the network have gone berserk.
M1090_S0230_G0030_001_pascal=We've sealed off the entrance to the village and are trying to hold them off, but...
M1090_S0230_G0040_001_pascal=With these weapons, there's only so much we can do...
M1090_S0230_G0050_001_a2b=Let's take these guys out first.
M1090_S0230_G0060_001_pascal=You saved us\! Oh, thank you so much...
M1090_S0230_G0070_001_a2b=What happened here?
M1090_S0230_G0080_001_pascal=The machines on the network all went berserk at the same moment.
M1090_S0230_G0090_001_pascal=I think the unit presiding over them may have gone mad.
M1090_S0230_G0100_001_a9s=It's Eve. It's got to be.
M1090_S0230_G0110_001_a2b=If we destroy this presiding unit, will it stop the rest?
M1090_S0230_G0120_001_pascal=Most likely, yes...
M1090_S0230_G0130_001_a2b=Pod, I need you to locate Eve's current position.
M1090_S0230_G0140_001_pod042=Location has been detected and placed on map.
M1090_S0230_G0150_001_a2b=We'll take care of Eve.
M1090_S0230_G0160_001_a9s=You just worry about keeping the village safe, okay?
M1090_S0230_G0170_001_pascal=Do be careful\!
M1090_S0230_G1060_001_pascal=You saved us\! Oh, thank you so much...
M1090_S0230_G1080_001_pascal=The machines on the network all went berserk at the same moment.
M1090_S0230_G1090_001_pascal=I think the unit presiding over them may have gone mad.
M1090_S0230_G1120_001_pascal=Most likely, yes...
