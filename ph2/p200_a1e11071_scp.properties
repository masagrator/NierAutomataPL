M1060_S0080_G0010_001_a9s=All the EMP shielding in the world won't help against close-range mortar fire.
M1060_S0080_G0020_001_a2b=Got it.
M1060_S0080_G0030_001_a9s=I'll help aim\!
M1060_S0080_G0040_001_a2b=Ngh... This thing's armor is too thick. We need more firepower.
M1060_S0080_G0050_001_a9s=2B\! Let's try for a more "direct" approach\!
M1060_S0080_G0060_001_a2b=Direct...? Oh, right\!
M1060_S0080_G0070_001_a9s=That's right\! Lay down some fire in its stupid mouth\!
