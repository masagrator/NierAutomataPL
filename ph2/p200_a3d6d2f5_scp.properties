M1050_S0010_G0000_001_a2b=...That concludes our report on the events surrounding the alien wreckage.
M1050_S0010_G0010_001_cmd=Then they were dead this whole time...
M1050_S0010_G0020_001_cmd=The Council of Humanity needs time to formulate a plan.
M1050_S0010_G0030_001_cmd=Until then, this information must be kept confidential.
M1050_S0010_G0040_001_cmd=Speak of it to no one.
M1050_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Of course.
M1050_S0010_G0060_001_cmd=Your next mission is to gather additional intel on the individual known as "Pascal."
M1050_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=You mean that freaky machine we ran into?
M1050_S0010_G0080_001_cmd=This order comes directly from the Council.
M1050_S0010_G0090_001_cmd=Knowledge of such unique individuals is essential for the success of future missions.
M1050_S0010_G0100_001_a2b=Understood.
M1050_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=Man, the Commander sure is a slave driver, huh?
M1050_S0010_G0111_001_a9s=And now we have to go back to the city ruins.
M1050_S0010_G0112_001_a9s=Why don't we rest a little bit, 2B? It's been a while.
M1050_S0010_G0113_001_a2b=I'll rest if I feel like it.
M1050_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=Man, this job can be pretty rough sometimes, huh?
M1050_S0010_G0130_001_a2b=We don't get to choose our assignments.
M1050_S0010_G0140_001_a2b=And you should work on keeping your opinions in check.
M1050_S0010_G0150_001_a2b=YoRHa aren't allowed to be emotional, remember?
M1050_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=I think some of us are better at that than others...
M1050_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=Speaking of emotion, those Adam and Eve units sure seemed less than logical.
M1050_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=I'm heading to the transporter.
M1050_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=Fiiine.
