M1050_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Um...
M1050_S0020_G0000_300_a9s=Let's hear them out. Maybe we'll learn more about the machine lifeforms.
M1050_S0020_G0010_001_pascal=Oh\! It's 9S and 2B, yes?
M1050_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=Those machines caused quite the ruckus, don't you think?
M1050_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=We need to talk.
M1050_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=Of course. I'll help however I can.
M1050_S0020_G0050_001_sele=Ask about Pascal's pacifism.
M1050_S0020_G0060_001_sele=Ask about the aliens.
M1050_S0020_G0070_001_sele=Ask about the other machines.
M1050_S0020_G0080_001_sele=Leave.
M1050_S0020_G0090_001_pascal=Okay. Let me know if there's anything you want to talk about.
M1050_S0020_G0100_001_a2b=Pascal. Why did you choose not to fight?
M1050_S0020_G0110_001_pascal=We have been alive for hundreds of years.
M1050_S0020_G0120_001_pascal=We lost countless friends, time and time again.
M1050_S0020_G0130_001_pascal=But losing friends isn't what scares me.
M1050_S0020_G0140_001_pascal=What scares me is the fact that I've grown used to seeing those I care about die all around me.
M1050_S0020_G0150_001_pascal=That's why I decided I'd had enough.
M1050_S0020_G0160_001_a2b=Do you know anything about the aliens?
M1050_S0020_G0170_001_pascal=The...aliens? You mean the ones who created us?
M1050_S0020_G0180_001_pascal=I'm sorry. There's not much I can tell you.
M1050_S0020_G0190_001_pascal=We've been fighting for centuries without a single message from them.
M1050_S0020_G0200_001_pascal=I guess you could say that the fact they never give us orders anymore is also a reason why we quit fighting.
M1050_S0040_G0080_001_a2b=Pascal?
M1050_S0040_G0090_001_pascal=Yes, 2B?
M1050_S0040_G0100_001_a2b=Aside from this village, are there any other machines that are cut off from the network?
M1050_S0040_G0110_001_pascal=Hmm...
M1050_S0040_G0120_001_pascal=I suppose that unpleasant songstress you so kindly defeated in the amusement park wasn't part of the network.
M1050_S0040_G0130_001_a9s=You mean that singing thing?
M1050_S0040_G0140_001_pascal=Oh, and of course there's the forest kingdom, butâ€”
M1050_S0040_G0150_001_a2b=Forest kingdom?
M1050_S0040_G0160_001_pascal=Yes. It's a vast woodland area not far from here.
M1050_S0040_G0170_001_pascal=There's a group of machines there attempting to build a nation of sorts.
M1050_S0040_G0180_001_pascal=They're quite hostile to outsiders, however. We can't so much as go near the place.
M1050_S0040_G0190_001_a2b=Where is it?
M1050_S0040_G0200_001_pascal=Northeast of the city ruins.
M1050_S0040_G0210_001_pascal=You should be able to reach it by passing through the ruins of the commercial facility.
M1050_S0040_G0220_001_pascal=If you go, however, be careful. Things have been rather rough there lately.
M1050_S0040_G0230_001_a9s=This...forest kingdom sounds like something we should check out.
