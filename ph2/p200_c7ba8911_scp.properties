M1060_S0120_G0000_101_pascal=That enormous machine is an ancient weapon.
M1060_S0120_G0010_101_pascal=It was designed to help annihilate the androids, but it wound up going out of control.
M1060_S0120_G0020_101_pascal=I was part of the machines' network when it happened, so I remember it.
M1060_S0120_G0030_101_pascal=The moment it reached land, it went berserk and began attacking everything in sight.
M1060_S0120_G0040_101_pascal=No one could figure out how to stop it.
M1060_S0120_G0050_101_pascal=We eventually marooned it deep in the ocean, but it seems to be searching for a way back.
M1060_S0120_G0060_101_a2b=Huh.
M1060_S0120_G0070_101_a9s=Hey, 2B?
M1060_S0120_G0080_101_a9s=I think I have another idea\!
M1060_S0120_G0090_101_a9s=You keep that thing right where it is, okay\!?
M1060_S0120_G0100_101_a2b=What\!?
M1060_S0120_G0110_101_a9s=Please, 2B\! This is gonna work\!
