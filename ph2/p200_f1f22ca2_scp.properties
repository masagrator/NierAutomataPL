M1080_S0030_G0000_300_pascal=Where are you going, 2B? The machine lifeforms wishing to form an alliance are in the abandoned factory.
M1080_S0030_G0480_101_pascal=The machines who seek to form an alliance with my village are hiding out here.
M1080_S0030_G0490_101_pascal=Still, you should probably be careful.
M1080_S0030_G0500_101_pascal=We machines can be rather...unpredictable.
M1080_S0030_G0510_101_a2b=Even you?
M1080_S0030_G0520_101_pascal=In truth, yes.
M1080_S0030_G0530_101_pascal=Now that we're cut off from the network, we no longer share data with each other.
M1080_S0030_G0540_101_pascal=We can speak, of course, but I find that language contains many ways to hide one's true intentions.
M1080_S0030_G0550_101_a2b=It certainly does.
M1080_S0040_S0000_101_n02=You enter the domain of God\!
M1080_S0050_G0000_101_n02=We have come to know the existence of God.
M1080_S0050_G0010_101_n02=And by His word, all living things are to be considered equal.
M1080_S0050_G0020_101_n02=His Grace wishes to form a pact of peace with your people.
M1080_S0050_G0030_101_n02=We, his humble priests, will guide you to him. This way.
M1080_S0050_G0040_101_pascal=This all seems pretty shady if you ask me...
M1080_S0050_G0050_101_a2b=So why are you still here?
M1080_S0050_G0050_300_n02=Stop\! We have no desire to fight you\!
M1080_S0050_G0060_101_pascal=Well, I brought you this far, didn't I?
M1080_S0050_G0060_300_pascal=Please, you must be calm\! We have come to negotiate peace with you\!
M1080_S0050_G0070_101_pascal=It's my duty to see this through to the end.
M1080_S0050_G0080_101_a2b=...Appreciated.
M1080_S0050_G0090_101_prst=Down this corridor, if you would.
M1080_S0050_G0100_101_prst=Please board this elevator to access His Grace's sanctum.
M1080_S0050_G0100_300_pascal=We should at least hear them out.
M1080_S0050_G0111_101_prst=You don't have to hurry so\! His Grace won't run from you.
