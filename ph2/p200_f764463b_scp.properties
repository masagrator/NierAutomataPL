M1060_S0120_G0000_101_pascal=That enormous machine is an ancient weapon.
M1060_S0120_G0010_101_pascal=It was designed to help annihilate the androids, but it wound up going out of control.
M1060_S0120_G0020_101_pascal=I was part of the machines' network when it happened, so I remember it.
M1060_S0120_G0030_101_pascal=The moment it reached land, it went berserk and began attacking everything in sight.
M1060_S0120_G0040_101_pascal=No one could figure out how to stop it.
M1060_S0120_G0050_101_pascal=We eventually marooned it deep in the ocean, but it seems to be searching for a way back.
M1060_S0120_G0060_101_a2b=Huh.
M1060_S0120_G0070_101_a9s=Hey, 2B?
M1060_S0120_G0080_101_a9s=I think I have another idea\!
M1060_S0120_G0090_101_a9s=You keep that thing right where it is, okay\!?
M1060_S0120_G0100_101_a2b=What\!?
M1060_S0120_G0110_101_a9s=Please, 2B\! This is gonna work\!
M1060_S0120_G0120_101_pod042=9S is leaving the front lines.
M1060_S0120_G0130_101_pod042=Proposal\: 9S should be reported to Command as a deserter.
M1060_S0120_G0140_101_a2b=No\!
M1060_S0120_G0150_101_a2b=He has a plan. Just hold on.
M1060_S0120_G0160_101_a9s=2B\!
M1060_S0120_G0170_101_a9s=I'm going to see if we can use those missiles back on the shore.
M1060_S0120_G0180_101_a9s=But I need you to destroy the EMP unit on that thing's back.
M1060_S0120_G0190_101_a9s=Otherwise they're just going to go off course.
M1060_S0120_G0200_101_a2b=On it.
