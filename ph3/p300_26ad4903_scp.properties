M3000_S0430_G0010_001_a9s=Did the virus infiltrate the Bunker itself?

M3000_S0430_G0030_001_a9s=Operator, what—
M3000_S0430_G0040_001_a2b=That's not the Operator. It's—
M3000_S0430_G0050_001_op60=We are your beloved machine lifeforms.
M3000_S0430_G0060_001_op60=We speak to you through the network and the virus.
M3000_S0430_G0070_001_cmd=How is that even possible\!?
M3000_S0430_G0080_001_op60=We've had a great deal of fun watching you squirm.
M3000_S0430_G0090_001_op60=But I'm afraid the end has come for this outpost.
M3000_S0430_G0100_001_op60=Ah ha\! Aaaaah ha ha ha\!
M3000_S0430_G0110_001_op60=Ah ha\! Aaaaah ha ha ha\!

M3000_S0430_G0172_001_a9s=Stay focused, 2B\!
M3000_S0430_G0180_001_pollutions=This food...isn't very good.
M3000_S0430_G0190_001_pollutions=Hee hee\! When does the war end? End?
M3000_S0430_G0191_001_op60=Two-Bee, I...am Operator 6O.

M3000_S0430_G0210_001_pollutions=Mankind... Man...kind...?
M3000_S0430_G0211_001_a9s=The transport terminal is corrupted. We need to get to the hangar and get some flight units\!
M3000_S0430_G0240_001_pollutions=Mission...accomplished.
M3000_S0430_G0250_001_pollutions=Co...Commander... Thank you...
M3000_S0430_G0260_001_cmd=Damn it\!\!
M3000_S0430_G0270_001_a2b=Commander, the Bunker is lost.
M3000_S0430_G0280_001_a2b=We have to evacuate.
M3000_S0430_G0290_001_cmd=But tell me—why weren't you two infected?
M3000_S0430_G0300_001_a2b=I don't know\!
M3000_S0430_G0310_001_a9s=It's probably because I deferred our data sync.
M3000_S0430_G0320_001_a9s=I noticed some weird noise in the Bunker's server data, so I paused the upload.
M3000_S0430_G0330_001_cmd=I see.
M3000_S0430_G0340_001_a2b=Commander, we need to get some flight units from the hangar and get out of here.
M3000_S0450_G0000_001_a2b=Commander\!
M3000_S0450_G0010_001_cmd=I, too, was synched up with the server...
M3000_S0450_G0020_001_a2b=But 9S can hack into your systems and—
M3000_S0450_G0030_001_cmd=There's no time\!
M3000_S0450_G0040_001_cmd=You two are the last remaining members of YoRHa.
M3000_S0450_G0050_001_cmd=It's your duty to survive.
M3000_S0450_G0060_001_a9s=But Commander...
M3000_S0450_G0070_001_cmd=Besides, this is my command.
M3000_S0450_G0080_001_cmd=Let me at least fulfill my duty here to the end...
M3000_S0460_H0000_001_a9s=2B, this place is lost\!
M3000_S0460_H0010_001_a2b=Commander\!
M3000_S0460_H0020_001_cmd=Move it, 2B\! That's an order\!
