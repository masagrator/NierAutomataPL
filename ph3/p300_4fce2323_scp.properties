M3030_S0025_G0000_001_a2=Right. Now I just have to bring this to Pascal...
M3030_S0025_G0010_001_pascal=A2, can you hear me\!?
M3030_S0025_G0020_001_a2=Oh, perfect. I have the materials you asked me to—
M3030_S0025_G0030_001_pascal=Help, A2\! The village is in great trouble\!
M3030_S0025_G0040_001_pascal=The villagers are— Oh, no...\!
M3030_S0025_G0050_001_a2=Pascal? Pascal, are you there\!?
M3030_S0025_G0060_001_a2=What the hell is going on\!?
M3030_S0025_G0070_001_pod042=Hypothesis\: The valuable source of information known as Pascal has encountered difficulty.
M3030_S0025_G0080_001_pod042=Proposal\: Unit A2 should investigate Pascal's village immediately.
M3030_S0025_G0090_001_a2=I'm on my way\!
M3030_S0025_G0100_300_pod042=Proposal\: Unit A2 should investigate the status of Pascal's village immediately.
M3030_S0025_G0110_300_a2=I know.
