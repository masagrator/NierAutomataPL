M3030_S0100_G0000_001_a2=Pascal\! Are you okay?
M3030_S0100_G0010_001_pascal=Oh, A2...
M3030_S0100_G0020_001_a2=So what exactly happened?
M3030_S0100_G0030_001_pascal=I don't know. Some of the villagers just started to...feed on each other.
M3030_S0100_G0040_001_pascal=If you hadn't come along, I'm sure we would have met the same grim fate.
M3030_S0100_G0050_001_pascal=Thank you.
M3030_S0100_G0060_001_select=Can't you regenerate your dead villagers?
M3030_S0100_G0070_001_select=Is this factory safe?
M3030_S0100_G0080_001_select=We really need more info...
M3030_S0100_G0090_001_pod042=Query\: We understand that machine lifeforms can regenerate as long as they possess the required materials. Is this accurate?
M3030_S0100_G0100_001_pascal=Unfortunately, we cannot regenerate our cores.
M3030_S0100_G0110_001_pascal=Cores contain the data which forms our self-consciousness.
M3030_S0100_G0120_001_pascal=If one is destroyed, there is no way to restore it.
M3030_S0100_G0130_001_pascal=We usually store our cores in safe places,
M3030_S0100_G0140_001_pascal=but this time, the villagers had their cores destroyed as well as their bodies.
M3030_S0100_G0150_001_a2=I see...
M3030_S0100_G0160_001_a2=So is this factory safe?
M3030_S0100_G0170_001_pascal=It was once occupied by a cadre of fellow machines that had gone berserk.
M3030_S0100_G0180_001_pascal=However, 2B took care of that threat.
M3030_S0100_G0190_001_pascal=It is quite safe now.
M3030_S0100_G0200_001_pascal=We've been using it for storage for some time.
M3030_S0100_G0210_001_a2=All right.
M3030_S0110_G0000_001_a2=Still, if we're gonna hole up here, I wish we had more info to work with...
M3030_S0110_G0010_001_pod042=Proposal\: Unit A2 should secure the safety of Pascal and the children immediately.
M3030_S0110_G0020_001_a2=What's the hurry?
M3030_S0110_G0030_001_pod042=Haste is predicated on data obtained from the recently restored cross-regional Pod network.
M3030_S0110_G0040_001_a2=Wait, there's more of you?
M3030_S0110_G0050_001_pod042=Affirmative.
M3030_S0110_G0060_001_pod042=Cross-regional data reveals a large number of machine lifeforms amassing around these ruins.
M3030_S0110_G0070_001_a2=What\!?
M3030_S0110_G0080_001_a2=Pascal\!
M3030_S0110_G0090_001_pascal=Aaaah\! A2\!
M3030_S0110_G0100_001_pod042=Alert\: Enemy reinforcements are infiltrating the facility.
M3030_S0110_G0110_001_a2=I'll smash 'em before they can reach this room.
M3030_S0110_G0120_001_pascal=You...you must let me help you\!
M3030_S0110_G0121_001_pascal=I will smash them up and kill them\!
M5910_S0100_G0155_001_pascal=...
