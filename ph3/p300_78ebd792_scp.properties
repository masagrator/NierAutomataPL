M3030_S0020_G0000_001_pascal=Hmm...
M3030_S0020_G0010_001_pascal="Where the state ceaseth, there only commenceth the man who is not superfluous."
M3030_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=Mmmm. I see.
M3030_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=It seems this Nietzsche was quite the profound thinker.
M3030_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=Or perhaps he skipped right past profound and went straight to crazy instead.
M3030_S0020_G0050_001_pascal=Ah, well. Enough of that.
M3030_S0020_G0060_001_pascal=I'd best go see the world for myself instead of burying my head in books.
M3030_S0020_G0070_001_child=Uncle Pascal, Uncle Pascal\! Play with us\!
M3030_S0020_G0080_001_children=Yeah\! Come on and play\!
M3030_S0020_G0090_001_pascal=Well, look at you\! Your speaking has improved so much.
M3030_S0020_G0100_001_pascal=But I fear you still haven't finished your studies, have you?
M3030_S0020_G0110_001_pascal=You promised to read and memorize that botanical field guide, remember?
M3030_S0020_G0120_001_child=But you'll play with us when we're done, right?
M3030_S0020_G0130_001_children=Yeah, promise us\!
M3030_S0020_G0140_001_pascal=Of course I will\! You have my word.
M3030_S0020_G0150_001_pascal=And Uncle Pascal would never lie and break his word.
M3030_S0020_G0160_001_pascal=Because children who lie grow up to be mean, evil machines\!
M3030_S0020_G0170_001_child=Aaaaah\!
M3030_S0020_G0180_001_children=Aaaaah\!
M3030_S0020_G0190_001_pascal=Hmmm? What's that?
