M3030_S0040_G0000_001_a2=What the hell?
M3030_S0040_G0010_001_a2=The machines are...eating each other\!?
M3030_S0040_G0020_001_a2=Pod, where's Pascal\!?
M3030_S0040_G0030_001_pod042=Unknown. Cannot establish connection.
M3030_S0040_G0040_001_pascal=Aaaah\! A2\!
M3030_S0040_G0050_001_a2=What happened\!?
M3030_S0040_G0060_001_pascal=I don't know.
M3030_S0040_G0070_001_pascal=Some of the villagers suddenly went mad.
M3030_S0040_G0080_001_pascal=They began attacking their friends.
M3030_S0040_G0090_001_pascal=I managed to help the children flee to safety.
M3030_S0040_G0100_001_pascal=But I fear everyone else is...
M3030_S0040_G0110_001_a2=You need to get out of here before you're next.
M3030_S0040_G0120_001_a2=Just go. Run\! I'll figure out how to handle this\!
M3030_S0040_G0130_001_pascal=But what about you?
M3030_S0040_G0140_001_a2=These guys can't touch me.
M3030_S0040_G0150_001_a2=Now move your ass\!
M3030_S0040_G0160_001_pascal=R-Right\!
M3030_S0040_G0161_300_a2=I can't leave this village to fend for itself.
M3030_S0040_G0170_001_a2=Is that all of them?
M3030_S0040_G0180_001_a2=Pod, scan for survivors.
M3030_S0040_G0190_001_pod042=Scanning. No life signs detected.
M3030_S0040_G0200_001_a2=None, huh...?
M3030_S0040_G0210_001_a2=Pascal, can you hear me?
M3030_S0040_G0220_001_pascal=Ah\! A2\!
M3030_S0040_G0230_001_pascal=How is my village? My people?
M3030_S0040_G0240_001_a2=I'm sorry. I couldn't help them.
M3030_S0040_G0250_001_pascal=Oh no....
M3030_S0040_G0260_001_a2=Are the children all right?
M3030_S0040_G0270_001_pascal=I've taken them to the abandoned factory.
M3030_S0040_G0280_001_a2=All right. I'm on my way.
