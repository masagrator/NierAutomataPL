M6010_S0090_G0100_300_op=Looks like I was wrong about you. Make sure you come back alive next time, too\!
M6010_S0090_G0110_300_op=It's do or die from now on. Good luck.
M6010_S0090_G0120_300_op=You were so cool\! Tell me about everything that happened, okay? Leave no detail unspoken\!
M6010_S0090_G0130_300_op=I'm gonna start a 2B fan club\!
M6010_S0090_G0140_300_op=I'm sorry I was so cold earlier—I clearly misjudged you. Thank you for taking care of Eve.
M6010_S0090_G0150_300_op=I can finally relax again. And it's all thanks to you and 9S\!
M6010_S0090_G0160_300_op=We're doing much better thanks to you. Great job\!
M6010_S0090_G0170_300_op=I know you'll keep doing great things.
M6010_S0090_G0180_300_op=I saw your battle with Eve. You have such amazing control over your body\! ...I'm kinda jealous.
M6010_S0090_G0190_300_op=Do you think you might give me some tips sometime?
M6010_S0090_G0200_300_op=You and 9S are the talk of the Bunker. You were incredible\!
M6010_S0090_G0210_300_op=We'll all be counting on you the next time some terrible machine thing tries to kill us all\!
M6010_S0090_G0220_300_op=That last battle looked really tough, but you pulled through. It was mesmerizing\!
M6010_S0090_G0230_300_op=Just so you know, you're quite popular with the operators\! ...Er, but you didn't hear that from me.
M6010_S0090_G0240_300_op=Man, I was sweating in my seat during that whole fight\! ...I was the one displaying Eve's remaining vitals, by the way. Hope it helped\!
M6010_S0090_G0250_300_op=Now get back out there and keep not dying\!
M6010_S0090_G0260_300_op=That was a spectacular victory\!
M6010_S0090_G0270_300_op=Here's to your next victory\!
M6010_S0090_G0280_300_op=Wow, 2B... That must have been tough.
M6010_S0090_G0290_300_op=Let's keep the winning streak going\! Woooo\!
M6010_S0090_G0300_300_op=I bet you'll get a sweet promotion after this. And even if you don't, please know that all of us are forever in your debt.
M6010_S0090_G0310_300_op=Thank you for everything.
M6010_S0100_G0100_300_op=Please don't talk to me when we're in the middle of a mission.
M6010_S0100_G0110_300_op=Oh, and good luck. We're all counting on you.
M6010_S0100_G0120_300_op=Please don't bug me when I'm working\!
M6010_S0100_G0130_300_op=Just get out there, kick some machine ass, and come back safe\!
M6010_S0100_G0140_300_op=Hurry and move out.
M6010_S0100_G0150_300_op=......
M6010_S0100_G0160_300_op=Good luck.
M6010_S0100_G0170_300_op=...Er, don't you think it's time to go?
M6010_S0100_G0180_300_op=Remember that any amazing combat data you collect dies with you, so be careful.
M6010_S0100_G0190_300_op=Try not to die out there.
M6010_S0100_G0200_300_op=Everyone's doing a great job\!
M6010_S0100_G0210_300_op=Now please hurry up and get going.
M6010_S0100_G0220_300_op=I've already started working. Please let me concentrate.
M6010_S0100_G0230_300_op=......
M6010_S0100_G0240_300_op=Ugh, you're such a pain\! Here we go again...
M6010_S0100_G0250_300_op=Don't worry, I'll give you perfect support.
M6010_S0100_G0260_300_op=It's almost time to head out.
M6010_S0100_G0270_300_op=You should probably get to the hangar.
M6010_S0100_G0280_300_op=This is a REALLY bad time for a chat\!
M6010_S0100_G0290_300_op=Oh, but good luck\!
M6010_S0100_G0300_300_op=This is my first large-scale mission. But don't worry—I increased my memory just in case.
M6010_S0100_G0310_300_op=You can count on me to make things work from this end\!
