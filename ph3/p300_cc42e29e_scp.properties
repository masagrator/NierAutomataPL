M3060_S0032_G0040_001_ppl=Come on, 9S\! Hack in while you can\!
M3060_S0032_G0050_001_a9s=None of this makes any sense\!
M3060_S0032_G0060_001_ppl=We'll explain everything once we're inside\!
M3060_S0032_G0070_001_a9s=Ugh\!
M3060_S0032_G0071_001_a9s=No... We can't just abandon them\!
M3060_S0032_G0072_001_a9s=If we don't do something, they're gonna...
M3060_S0032_G0073_001_pod153=Alert\: Leaving the zone of combat would mean abandoning the androids Devola and Popola.
M3060_S0032_G0074_001_pod153=Proposal\: Hack into the main Tower unit.
M3060_S0032_G0200_300_dbl=Where are you going, 9S? We need you\!
M3060_S0032_G0210_300_ppl=9S, come back\! We can't hold out by ourselves\!

M3060_S0032_G0250_300_dbl=Damn... Looks like this is it.
M3060_S0032_G0260_300_ppl=No...
M3060_S0032_G0270_300_dbl=We've got this, 9S\! You just focus on hacking\!
M3060_S0032_G0280_300_dbl=You need to hack the Tower lock open\!
M3060_S0032_G0290_300_ppl=9S\! You must hack into the Tower\!
M3060_S0032_G0300_300_ppl=We...we can't hold out like this\!
M3060_S0032_G0310_300_dbl=9S\! I can't do this anymore\!
