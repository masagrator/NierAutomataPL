M3000_S0410_G0010_001_a2b=We have to report back to Command.
M3000_S0420_S0000_001_a9s=Whoa...
M3000_S0424_G0000_001_a2b=Commander.
M3000_S0424_G0010_001_cmd=2B? 9S?
M3000_S0424_G0020_001_cmd=What are you doing here?
M3000_S0424_G0030_001_a9s=The YoRHa units on the ground were infected by a virus.
M3000_S0424_G0040_001_a9s=We had to detonate our black boxes in order to stop them.
M3000_S0424_G0050_001_cmd=A...virus? What are you talking about?
M3000_S0424_G0060_001_cmd=None of our ground units reported anything about a virus.
M3000_S0424_G0070_001_a9s=That's because all communication with the Bunker has been severed.
M3000_S0424_G0080_001_cmd=And why did you leave the battlefield anyway? I didn't order a retreat.
M3000_S0424_G0090_001_a2b=We're telling you, YoRHa has gone berserk\!
M3000_S0424_G0100_001_cmd=......
M3000_S0424_G0110_001_cmd=No.
M3000_S0424_G0120_001_cmd=If anyone is acting infected here, it's you.
M3000_S0424_G0130_001_a9s=Are you NUTS\!?
