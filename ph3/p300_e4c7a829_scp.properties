M6010_S0090_G0320_300_ys=Oh, hold on a second, 2B's here...
M6010_S0090_G0330_300_ys=Hey, don't you have something to do? Get the lead out\!
M6010_S0090_G0340_300_ys=I've figured out how to deal with her. Just let her say all she wants to say first and then ask only about the points that don't make sense.
M6010_S0090_G0350_300_ys=Her explanations are comprehensive, so that works best.
M6010_S0090_G0370_300_ys=I realized that my sensory settings were making me hear operator speech as background noise for some reason\!
M6010_S0090_G0380_300_ys=That's why I was having such a hard time understanding stuff. But they made a couple of tweaks and now I'm good to go\!
M6010_S0090_G0390_300_ys=I think my problems are over now\!
M6010_S0090_G0400_300_op=She's been picking things up quickly lately. It makes my job a lot easier\!
M6010_S0090_G0410_300_op=She really can do anything if she puts her mind to it.
M6010_S0090_G0420_300_op=I guess my voice was being processed as static or something? I don't really get the detailsâ€”I'm just glad it's solved.
M6010_S0090_G0430_300_op=Her heart's always been in the right place regardless, so I'm happy I stuck with it.
M6010_S0090_G0440_300_ys=In the end, Eve was defeated without my help. I know I should be happy regardless, but I just...
M6010_S0090_G0450_300_ys=Well anyway, thanks.
M6010_S0090_G0460_300_op=If she was in perfect condition, she would have taken Eve or anyone else down in one hit\! Still, it's the end result that counts.
M6010_S0090_G0470_300_op=We'll make sure she's ready for the next attack\!
M6010_S0090_G0520_300_ys=Listen up\! Make sure you download every last bit of data from 2B and 9S's battle into your heads\!
M6010_S0090_G0530_300_ys=Those machines are going to be piles of scrap with this intel at our fingertips\!
M6010_S0090_G0540_300_ys=We'll make good use of your battle data.
M6010_S0090_G0550_300_ys=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0090_G0560_300_ys=You guys are amazing. Seriously, I could never have done that...
M6010_S0090_G0570_300_ys=I'm still going to keep trying my best, though. Even if my best is only about 1/47 as good as your best...
M6010_S0090_G0580_300_ys=Glory to mankind.
M6010_S0090_G0590_300_ys=Wait... This isn't our commanding officer's battle data\! Well, I guess it'll still be useful.
M6010_S0090_G0600_300_ys=Glory to mankind.
M6010_S0090_G0610_300_op=I feel like this team's grown a lot. They probably won't even need my help soon.
M6010_S0090_G0620_300_op=Yep. This team is going to be fine without me.
M6010_S0100_G0320_300_ys=...Sorry, someone needs to speak with me.
M6010_S0100_G0330_300_ys=Just get going, okay? I'll be right behind you.
M6010_S0100_G0340_300_ys=It's go time\!
M6010_S0100_G0350_300_ys=I understand the plan and agree with it completely. Now we all just have to do our part\!
M6010_S0100_G0360_300_ys=Let's be in this thing to win this thing\!
M6010_S0100_G0370_300_ys=Thanks to my operator, I understand the plan perfectly.
M6010_S0100_G0380_300_op=I've done my part. Now it's in her hands.
M6010_S0100_G0390_300_op=...You know what? We make a pretty darn good team\!
M6010_S0100_G0400_300_op=I've given her all the information I have. Now it's up to her.
M6010_S0100_G0410_300_op=I know she can do it... I know it\!
M6010_S0100_G0420_300_ys=What do you mean, I can't head out yet? Find the problem and fix it already\!
M6010_S0100_G0430_300_op=Uh-oh... These readings don't look good...
M6010_S0100_G0440_300_op=Good luck.
M6010_S0100_G0470_300_ys=Listen up, you lot\! It's time to show me what you've learned\!
M6010_S0100_G0480_300_ys=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0100_G0490_300_ys=We'll make good use of your battle data.
M6010_S0100_G0500_300_ys=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0100_G0510_300_ys=I owe everything to my commanding officer, so I'll do my best for her sake.
M6010_S0100_G0520_300_ys=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0100_G0530_300_ys=Time to show them what we can do...
M6010_S0100_G0540_300_ys=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0100_G0550_300_op=All we can do now is hope.
M6010_S0100_G0560_300_op=Glory to mankind\!
