M5910_S0300_G0000_001_a2=There's machines everywhere...
M5910_S0300_G0010_001_pod042=Analysis\: This is a colony of pacifistic machine lifeforms led by the unit known as Pascal.
M5910_S0300_G0020_001_pod042=It is logical for a large number of machine lifeforms to be present.
M5910_S0300_G0030_001_pod042=This Pod has concerns regarding YoRHa unit A2's predictive skills.
M5910_S0300_G0040_001_a2=I'd be more concerned about me smashing your face if I were you.
M5910_S0300_G0050_001_pascal=Ah\! It's the woman from before\!
M5910_S0300_G0060_001_pascal=Thank you again for rescuing me.
M5910_S0300_G0070_001_a2=......
M5910_S0300_G0080_001_pascal=Now then\! How can I help you?
M5910_S0300_G0090_001_a2=......
M5910_S0300_G0100_001_pascal=Um...
M5910_S0300_G0110_001_pod042=Summary\: YoRHa unit A2 possesses a faulty fuel filter.
M5910_S0300_G0120_001_pod042=She has obtained information from Anemone, leader of the Resistance camp.
M5910_S0300_G0130_001_pod042=She has traveled to this village in order to obtain a new filter. End summary.
M5910_S0300_G0140_001_pod042=Request\: One functional fuel filter.
M5910_S0300_G0150_001_a2=Do you really need to spell it all out like that?
M5910_S0300_G0160_001_pod042=Analysis\: A2's lack of verbal communication made this Pod's assistance necessary.
M5910_S0300_G0170_001_a2=Shut. Up.
M5910_S0300_G0180_001_pascal=Ah, I see, I see.
M5910_S0300_G0190_001_pascal=Sadly, I'm a bit short on materials right now.
M5910_S0300_G0200_001_pascal=I need rigid tree bark to create a filter, but the only location I know of is guarded by ferocious machine lifeforms.
M5910_S0300_G0210_001_pascal=I apologize, but I'm afraid I can't make a filter at the moment.
M5910_S0300_G0220_001_pod042=Confirmation\: Unit A2 will secure and deliver rigid tree bark.
M5910_S0300_G0230_001_a2=Don't confirm that by yourself\!
M5910_S0300_G0240_001_pascal=I need some rigid tree bark to create a filter, but I can't fetch any at the moment.
M5910_S0310_G0000_001_pod042=Areas where rigid tree bark is available marked on map.
M5910_S0310_G0010_001_a2=Goddammit...
M5910_S0310_G0020_001_pod042=Analysis\: Hostility toward the peaceful machine lifeform Pascal is pointless from an energy-usage standpoint.
M5910_S0310_G0030_001_pod042=Proposal\: Form a friendly relationship immediately.
M5910_S0310_G0040_001_a2=You have GOT to be kidding me.
M5910_S0310_G0050_001_a2=Guess I'll go back to that machine...
M5910_S0310_G0060_001_a2=Here's your stuff.
M5910_S0310_G0070_001_pascal=Ah\! Thank you so much.
M5910_S0310_G0080_001_pascal=I'll make a filter right away. Please just give me one moment.
M5910_S0310_G0090_001_a2=He can fly?
M5910_S0310_G0100_001_pod042=Alert\: The machine lifeform Pascal has returned.
M5910_S0310_G0110_001_a2=......
