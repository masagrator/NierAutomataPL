M5224_S0010_G0000_001_n02=I really respect Pascal, you know?
M5224_S0010_G0010_001_n02=I mean, he's the one who thought to build this village for us outcasts.
M5224_S0010_G0020_001_n02=I really need to show him how thankful I am\!
M5224_S0010_G0030_001_n02=If ooooonly there were some way to thank him...\nSooooome way...
M5224_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Stick around and hear him out.
M5224_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Leave before you get dragged into something.
M5224_S0010_G0060_001_a2=Yeah, yeah. I can take the hint.
M5224_S0010_G0070_001_n02=No hint\! I just want to show Pascal how appreciated he is.
M5224_S0010_G0080_001_n02=Anyway, I was thinking he might like a new philosophy book.\nI hear they have such things over in the Resistance camp...
M5224_S0010_G0090_001_sele=Agree to get the book.
M5224_S0010_G0100_001_sele=Tell the machine to get bent.
M5224_S0010_G0110_001_a2=All right, I'll get your book. I owe that little clunker a favor or two anyway.
M5224_S0010_G0120_001_n02=Oh, that's wonderful\!
M5224_S0010_G0130_001_n02=Apparently someone named "Anemone" has a large collection of such books, so you just need to go steal one\!
M5224_S0010_G0140_001_a2=Uh, yeah, no. I think there's a better way.
M5224_S0020_G0150_001_ane=Pascal wants books on philosophy?
M5224_S0020_G0160_001_ane=Well, as it happens, I just finished this one the other day.
M5224_S0020_G0170_001_ane=You're welcome to take it if you like.
M5224_S0020_G0180_001_a2=Thanks.
M5224_S0020_G0181_001_ane=Could you give him this gold ore as well? He's been asking for this for a while, and I finally managed to get my hands on some.
M5224_S0020_G0182_001_a2=All right.
M5224_S0020_G0190_001_ane=It seems...odd that a machine lifeform would be into philosophy, don't you think?
M5224_S0020_G0200_001_ane=It makes me wonder how much we really know about our enemy...
M5224_S0020_G0210_001_a2=I wonder.
