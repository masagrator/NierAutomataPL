M6150_S0010_G0020_001_dreamR2=A friend of mine said he's been seeing images of himself doing things while in sleep mode.
M6150_S0010_G0030_001_dreamR2=He became so obsessed with these images that he started spending more and more time in sleep mode every day.
M6150_S0010_G0040_001_dreamR2=Then, after that big battle the other day, he said "I'm staying in the other world," and he never woke up again.
M6150_S0010_G0050_001_dreamR2=I wonder if he's ever going to reactivate...
M6150_S0010_G0060_001_dreamR2=He lost so many of his friends during that battle the other day... Maybe despair drove him to live in that other world of his.
M6150_S0010_G0070_001_dreamR2=Maybe he'll wake up again once this world is at peace?
M6150_S0020_G0010_001_restR=Because of that huge battle the other day, we're low on labor power and supplies...
M6150_S0020_G0020_001_restR=We're expected to work 20 hours a day now...
M6150_S0030_G0020_001_terminalR=We lost more than half of our troops in that huge battle the other day.
M6150_S0030_G0030_001_terminalR=Who knew Plato 1728 had such special powers in him though, huh?
M6150_S0040_G0030_001_watchR=There's a shortage of machines at all factories nowadays. Fixing a simple hallway is taking forever.
M6150_S0040_G0040_001_watchR=I don't wanna think about how long I'm gonna have to hover around here.
M6150_S0040_G0050_001_watchR=Maybe I should attach a legged unit... NO\! My pride won't allow it\!
M6150_S0050_G0020_001_lookR=Oh, how could I have been so stupid\!?
M6150_S0050_G0030_001_lookR=That building... It's exactly what us lifeless creatures have longed for\!
M6150_S0060_G0020_001_attractR=Plato 1728... You...made it inside...didn't you?
M6150_S0060_G0030_001_attractR=I'll...be going there...soon...too...
M6150_S0070_G0030_001_frightenedR=I can't believe he'd go crazy like that...
M6150_S0070_G0040_001_frightenedR=I can't do this\! I don't want to be part of this war anymore\!
M6150_S0080_G0020_001_encourageR=This guy got promoted after his training the other day, so he got sent to the battlefield for the first time.
M6150_S0080_G0030_001_encourageR=But then he had to witness Plato going insane with his own eyes, and he's been like this ever since.
M6150_S0080_G0040_001_encourageR=I wasn't there, so I don't know much about what happened. Was it really that terrifying?
M6150_S0090_G0010_001_audienceR=Bwahaha\! Destroy\! Destroy\! Destroy\!
M6150_S0100_G0010_001_audienceR=Go\! Take them apart\! I don't want to see a single bolt remain\!
M6150_S0110_G0010_001_audienceR=Don't hold back\! Your life's on the line\!
M6150_S0120_G0030_001_questionR=Oh, hey.
M6150_S0120_G0040_001_questionR=After that big battle the other day, I figured everyone would be sick of fighting, but it seems they've fallen in love with this place more than ever.
M6150_S0120_G0050_001_questionR=How could anyone want to be in a place like this after facing so many horrors and losing so many loved ones?
M6150_S0130_G0020_001_duskR=We lost so many units in the war that the production lines are running at full speed now.
M6150_S0130_G0030_001_duskR=Old units get destroyed, new ones get made... It's as if they're being created just to be demolished again...
M6150_S0140_G0020_001_badR=Plato 1728... He was an idiot, but he wasn't a bad guy.
M6150_S0140_G0030_001_badR=No matter how much everyone made fun of him, he never spoke ill of anyone.
M6150_S0140_G0040_001_badR=And yet I... I... \nI'm sorry, Plato 1728...
M6150_S0150_G0020_001_badR=Dammit, I can't believe he'd go haywire and destroy all his friends like that\!
M6150_S0150_G0030_001_badR=He's been nothing but a pain for everyone. We shoulda gotten rid of him ages ago\!
M6150_S0150_G0040_001_badR=Why are they even making his models anymore\!?
M6150_S0155_G0000_001_enthusiasticR=For today's trial, I had a new body procured that excels at athletics.
M6150_S0155_G0010_001_enthusiasticR=I have to make up for holding all of my team mates back during the last match. I'm gonna get a promotion and protect everyone\!
M6150_S0160_G0020_001_difficultR=I can choose to go to battle, or I can be in charge of transporting supplies, which means I have to work with chairs every day. I don't know which is worse.
M6150_S0160_G0030_001_difficultR=Screw the human that invented chairs, seriously.
M6150_S0160_G0040_001_difficultR=I have made it my life's goal to rid this planet of chairs.
M6150_S0160_G0050_001_difficultR=Are you with me, comrade\!?
M6150_S0170_G0020_001_enthusiasticR=Those cruel, disgusting androids completely annihilated all of our units, even the non-combat types\! This is unforgivable\!
M6150_S0170_G0030_001_enthusiasticR=As soon as this weapon is complete, I will make them kneel before us\! I will make them beg for their lives, before ripping them to shreds\!\!
M6150_S0180_G0020_001_childR=I hope he wakes up soon\!
M6150_S0180_G0030_001_childR=I'm sure we're gonna be best friends\!
M6150_S0190_G0010_001_lookR=There were some problems during development, so unfortunately the weapon was not ready in time.
M6150_S0190_G0020_001_lookR=Once it is complete though, I'm sure it'll help us save the lives of many of our friends.
M6150_S0200_G0020_001_restR=It feels like we're getting busier every single day.
M6150_S0200_G0030_001_restR=We've put so much effort into this thing, I don't even wanna think about the possibility of the androids destroying it...
M6150_S0210_G0020_001_restR=Have to work Have to work Have to work Have to work
M6150_S0210_G0030_001_restR=It feels good to live such a rich and busy life\!
M6150_S0220_G0010_001_duskR=Jump, work, jump, work, jump, work, jump, work, jump, work...
M6150_S0230_G0010_001_terminalR=Don't talk to people when they're busy. It's common sense at any workplace, really.
M6150_S0240_G0010_001_terminalR=And then this goes here...and that goes there...\nAaaaand everything's buggy now for some reason. GREAT.
M6150_S0250_G0010_001_terminalR=Don't you ever wonder why bugs exist in the first place?
M6150_S0250_G0020_001_terminalR=Figuring that one out must be the path to true enlightenment.
M6150_S0260_G0010_001_terminalR=We lost a squad near the forest area. I need a reconnaisance team out there, stat\!
M6150_S0260_G0020_001_terminalR=Be advised that enemies have been spotted in the vicinity. Proceed with caution.
M6150_S0270_G0020_001_terminalR=The last battle also resulted in many machine losses because of YoRHa.
M6150_S0270_G0030_001_terminalR=I hope they don't mass-produce these units, because we'd be screwed.
M6150_S0280_G0010_001_terminalR=Production of this weapon is taking way too long...
M6150_S0290_G0020_001_terminalR=I've been getting a lot of requests for repairs of borrowed weapons.
M6150_S0290_G0030_001_terminalR=I'm thinking of making this month's motto "Take care of your weapons so they can take care of you\!"
M6150_S0300_G0010_001_terminalR=..............................
M6150_S0300_G0020_001_terminalR=Oh, sorry, I had my sound sensors turned off because this room is so damn noisy. I quite recommend it\!
M6150_S0310_G0010_001_terminalR=I don't even know whether we're working to live or living to work anymore.
M6150_S0310_G0020_001_terminalR=What do you think?
M6150_S0320_G0010_001_terminalR=I haven't been home in 4 days\!
M6150_S0330_G0010_001_terminalR=Stop talking to me...
M6150_S0340_G0010_001_terminalR=What could possibly be worth this much effort?
M6150_S0350_G0010_001_terminalR=Building that giant weapon, Plato 1728 going crazy... I've got enough on my plate already\!
M6150_S0360_G0060_001_terminalR=Hey. So you're on data management duty today as well, huh? \nYou got a minute?
M6150_S0360_G0070_001_terminalR=I've been getting a lot of complaints from the employees about our working conditions lately, bunch of whiners.
M6150_S0360_G0080_001_terminalR=If we cared about our workers' happiness, we would've called this place a SATISFACTORY. Pfffffffhehehe.
M6150_S0370_G0020_001_terminalR=I've given up on thinking about things. All I care about is work. Yes sirree, work and nothing else. Love it.
M6150_S0380_G0010_001_terminalR=This is the 28th District Command Center, calling all ground troops. We are currently short on combat units.
M6150_S0380_G0020_001_terminalR=We will not be able to supply new troops for a while. You'll have to work together to complete your missions. Over and out.
M6150_S0390_G0020_001_terminalR=Squad 13, please respond.
M6150_S0390_G0030_001_terminalR=We have lost contact with Squad 14. Head over to their location to provide backup immediately.
M6150_S0400_G0010_001_terminalR=We've suffered so many losses during the great battle that I can't keep track of all the data.
M6150_S0410_G0010_001_terminalR=Plato 1728's little "accident" caused a lot of damage, but it resulted in some very valuable data as well.
M6150_S0410_G0020_001_terminalR=If we can somehow harness that anger, we might be able to defeat the YoRHa troops.
M6150_S0420_G0010_001_terminalR=I was thinking of converting to a combat model, but then I read the report on the great battle, and I was like "Nope nope nope."
M6150_S0420_G0020_001_terminalR=I'll take tired hands over getting destroyed any day, thank you.
M6150_S0430_G0010_001_terminalR=Hello, can you hear me?
M6150_S0430_G0020_001_terminalR=Dammit, we lost contact with this squad too. I can't remember the last time we suffered this many losses.
M6150_S0440_G0020_001_terminalR=The whole Plato 1728 incident has caused massive losses to both us and the enemy. There's no one left there\!
M6150_S0440_G0030_001_terminalR=On top of that, I have to deal with this confusing data. I have no idea what's going on anymore.
M6150_S0441_G0010_001_terminalR=Third battalion, head to the location of the incident and see if there are any survivors. Gather any intel you can find.
M6150_S0442_G0010_001_terminalR=I've got tons of work to do, just because that jerk decided to go haywire.
M6150_S0460_G0020_001_terminalR=Do you think Plato 1728 was fully responsible for what he did?
M6150_S0460_G0030_001_terminalR=Personally, I can't blame him. Something must have set him off somehow.
M6150_S0460_G0040_001_terminalR=I think everyone's just reluctant to face the truth.
M6150_S0470_G0010_001_terminalR=The YoRHa troops have wreaked havoc on the machine army once again...
M6150_S0480_G0010_001_terminalR=How many lives do you think have been lost in this battle?
M6150_S0480_G0020_001_terminalR=Is there no road to peace\!?\nSorry, I'm just rambling. Forget what I said.
M6150_S0490_G0020_001_terminalR=We've had a lot of deserters since the great battle.
M6150_S0490_G0030_001_terminalR=It's enough of a pain in the rear to maintain a list of all units as it is. I wish they'd at least tell us if they were bailing.
M6150_S0500_G0010_001_terminalR=Hmph. How are we gonna stop all these troops from deserting?
M6150_S0500_G0020_001_terminalR=I know\! I'll just give 'em more work so they won't have time to escape or even THINK of escaping\!
M6150_S0520_G0010_001_terminalR=............I don't even have time to move my mouth.
M6150_S0530_G0010_001_terminalR=One of my friends is really into this thing called "religion."
M6150_S0530_G0020_001_terminalR=Maybe I should go to one of their seminars.
M6150_S0540_G0010_001_terminalR=I used to hate the air in this room, but I've spent so much time here that I've kind of grown to like it\!
M6150_S0550_G0020_001_terminalR=Frankly, things haven't been looking good for us machines lately. We have to find the enemy camp, and fast.
M6150_S0560_G0010_001_terminalR=People in the old world used spies to gather information, but androids and machines look so different, it would never work.
M6150_S0565_G0010_001_terminalR=I've heard that something called "religion" is gaining popularity in some districts. Apparently there's a "Grace" who's been chosen by "God"?
M6150_S0570_G0020_001_terminalR=Bloody pacifists. They're using the great battle from the other day as an excuse to recruit members\!
M6150_S0570_G0030_001_terminalR=The mere thought of making friends with those vile androids makes me want to retch\!
M6150_S0580_G0010_001_terminalR=This damn terminal always freezes on me RIGHT when I'm about to complete a task.
M6150_S0590_G0010_001_terminalR=I heard there's this thing called "religion" that's really popular right now.
M6150_S0590_G0020_001_terminalR=Apparently they promise you eternal peace if you join them?
M6150_S0600_G0010_001_terminalR=*sigh* Oh, hey.\nHow many nights have YOU worked in a row now?
M6150_S0600_G0020_001_terminalR=I haven't had a rest in 6 days\! Pretty impressive, huh?\nI'm completely exhausted though.
M6150_S0610_G0010_001_terminalR=According to some old books, workers used to have a weapon called "overtime pay." They also had "strikes" and "paid leave."
M6150_S0610_G0020_001_terminalR=Whoever wielded these weapons was assured victory. I wonder how one goes about obtaining them...
M6150_S0620_G0020_001_terminalR=People who complain about their jobs will end up complaining about everything, no matter what they do.
M6150_S0620_G0030_001_terminalR=It all comes down to getting your feelings under control, you know?
M6150_S0630_G0010_001_terminalR=I've been working for hours on end, and my core is getting as hot as this terminal.
M6150_S0630_G0020_001_terminalR=Together, we're generating enough heat to burn a small planet\!
M6150_S0640_G0020_001_bossR2=Hey, remember how you used to talk all big to me until recently?
M6150_S0640_G0030_001_bossR2=Well, don't worry about it. After all, you've got about 20 hours until starting time tomorrow, right?
M6150_S0650_G0020_001_subordinateR2=I'm sorry. I don't think I can finish all of my work before the end of the day.
M6150_S0650_G0030_001_subordinateR2=I'm sorry\! I'm so sorry\! I just got carried away a bit, is all\!
M6150_S0655_G0010_001_lookR=These guys over here? The one used to be the other's boss, until he messed up, and now the tables have turned.
M6150_S0655_G0020_001_lookR=And now that the other guy's the boss, he's doing the exact same things that made him hate his former boss so much.
M6150_S0655_G0030_001_lookR=I used to think your personality was innate, but now I think it's heavily influenced by how much power you wield.
M6150_S0670_G0010_001_loafR2=This is the best spot for slacking off\!
M6150_S0680_G0010_001_putR=I keep cleaning up, and somebody keeps making a mess\! I'm so sick of this\! Why can't anyone clean up after themselves\!?
M6150_S0680_G0020_001_putR=Next time, I'm gonna throw all of this stuff in the trash\!
M6150_S0690_G0010_001_putR=I should probably modify my body for transport purposes.
M6150_S0700_G0010_001_loafR2=The most important thing when trying to look busy is your face. Just look as if you're in deep thought, and no one will bother you\!
M6150_S0710_G0010_001_loafR2=I'm so tired I'm starting to see things. I must have found the true path to enlightenment\!
M6150_S0720_G0010_001_restR=I'm sick of work. I'm sick of work. I'm sick of work. I'm sick of work.
M6150_S0730_G0000_001_teruterubozu=...
M6150_S0730_G0010_001_attractR=...
M6150_S0740_G0010_001_frightenedR=.........
