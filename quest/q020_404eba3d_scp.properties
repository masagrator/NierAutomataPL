M5020_S0010_G0000_001_sarutoru=Existence precedes essence.
M5020_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Um...
M5020_S0010_G0020_001_sarutoru=Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself. Additionally—
M5020_S0010_G0020_300_n02=The machine with the painted face is in the lower section of the village.
M5020_S0010_G0030_001_a9s=Um, hello?
M5020_S0010_G0030_300_n02=Have you learned a bit about <SARU_JAN> now?
M5020_S0010_G0040_001_sarutoru=Yes? And you are?
M5020_S0010_G0050_001_sarutoru=Wait\! Do not tell me\! I have already deduced that you are here to listen to me expound upon the great mysteries of existence.
M5020_S0010_G0060_001_sarutoru=Well enough\! Let us begin by discussing the concept of existentialism.
M5020_S0010_G0070_001_sarutoru=Essence and existence are two sides of the same coin.
M5020_S0010_G0080_001_sarutoru=And yet, what IS existence? I'm glad you asked\! To answer that will require many long hours of—
M5020_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=This is pointless.
M5020_S0010_G0100_001_n02=There's no point in talking to <SARU_JAN>. We stopped trying to figure him out a while ago.
M5020_S0010_G0110_001_n02=All he does is spout a bunch of mumbo-jumbo about something called "philosophy."
M5020_S0010_G0120_001_n02=If you're curious about him, you'll have better luck talking to his followers. They tend to use smaller words, at least.
M5020_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=This guy has followers?
M5020_S0010_G0140_001_n02=More like fans, I suppose. But yes, there are a quite a few out there who buy what he's selling. Don't ask me why.
M5020_S0010_G0150_001_n02=Some folks just get into that sort of thing, I suppose.
M5020_S0010_G0160_001_n02=There's even one <SARU_JAN> follower right here in this village.
M5020_S0010_G0170_001_n02=You know the machine with the thick paint on her face? That's the one.
M5020_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Hello. Can we ask you a question?
M5020_S0020_G0000_300_sarutoru=Oh ho\! Have you come to hear my lecture as well?
M5020_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Do you happen to know a machine named <SARU_JAN>?
M5020_S0020_G0010_300_a9s=I'm good, thanks.
M5020_S0020_G0020_001_robogirl=I certainly do\! Master <SARU_JAN> is a genius. You can rely on him for absolutely anything.
M5020_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Are we talking about the same <SARU_JAN> here?
M5020_S0020_G0040_001_robogirl=In fact, I was just thinking about how much wisdom he has to teach me, so I wrote him a letter asking for guidance. You'll take it to him, won't you?
M5020_S0020_G0040_300_robogirl=Did you deliver my letter?
M5020_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=Huh\!?
M5020_S0020_G0050_300_robogirl=Did you deliver my gift?
M5020_S0020_G0060_001_robogirl=I can't let that lady in the desert get to him first\! Or that harpy in the amusement park...
M5020_S0020_G0060_300_robogirl=Did you deliver my gift?
M5020_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=Great. There are more of these weirdos?
M5020_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=And wait, they have genders?
M5020_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=Um...
M5020_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=Hello. Do you know of a machine named <SARU_JAN> who lives in the village?
M5020_S0020_G0110_001_robogirl=Master <SARU_JAN> is quite the mysterious gentleman. One might even go so far as to call him suspicious. And yet he's so alluring all the same\!
M5020_S0020_G0120_001_a2b=Suspicious...and alluring?
M5020_S0020_G0130_001_robogirl=Exactly. And I know just the gift for someone of that description\!
M5020_S0020_G0140_001_robogirl=You'll deliver it to him straightaway, won't you?
M5020_S0020_G0150_001_robogirl=I won't let that terrible girl in the desert find a way to interfere with our love\!
M5020_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=Hello there.
M5020_S0020_G0170_001_robogirl=Ack\!
M5020_S0020_G0180_001_a9s=Huh?
M5020_S0020_G0190_001_robogirl=You came here from Master <SARU_JAN>'s village, didn't you?
M5020_S0020_G0200_001_robogirl=I can tell. I can smell him on you. *sniiiiiiiiff* Ahhhhh\!
M5020_S0020_G0210_001_a9s=Okay. That's weird.
M5020_S0020_G0220_001_robogirl=<SARU_JAN> is wonderful. He pursues new knowledge with a passion that is almost indescribable. I admire him as I do no other.
M5020_S0020_G0230_001_a2b=You have issues.
M5020_S0020_G0240_001_robogirl=And YOU clearly lack a discerning eye. I bet men take advantage of you all the time.
M5020_S0020_G0250_001_a2b=Not exactly.
M5020_S0020_G0260_001_robogirl=Ah, right.
M5020_S0020_G0270_001_robogirl=I found something that Master <SARU_JAN> is sure to be interested in. Please take it to him with all speed\!
M5020_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=Hey, 2B? I've been thinking about something.
M5020_S0030_G0010_001_a2b=What?
M5020_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Do you think this <SARU_JAN> fellow is being a little too...I dunno. Glorified?
M5020_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=That's certainly one way to put it...
M5020_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=Hello?
M5020_S0040_G0010_001_sarutoru=Ah, yes. I see.
M5020_S0040_G0020_001_sarutoru=Dreams are the mind's version of reality perfected.
M5020_S0040_G0030_001_a9s=Hey, <SARU_JAN>? We have a delivery for you.
M5020_S0040_G0040_001_sarutoru=Ah\! Allow me to see it at once.
M5020_S0040_G0050_001_sarutoru=Interesting. A letter, is it?
M5020_S0040_G0060_001_a2b=A female machine asked us to deliver it to you.
M5020_S0040_G0070_001_a2b=She said she could rely on you, and that you know pretty much everything.
M5020_S0040_G0080_001_sarutoru=Yes, yes. Now if I may, do you believe that existence precedes essence?
M5020_S0040_G0090_001_a9s=Um, is this about the letter?
M5020_S0040_G0100_001_sarutoru=No.
M5020_S0040_G0110_001_a9s=Right, but shouldn't you maybe respond to the letter?
M5020_S0040_G0120_001_sarutoru=Is one duty-bound to reply to every question spewed in their direction?
M5020_S0040_G0130_001_sarutoru=If such is your claim, then what power was it who placed this burdensome yoke about my neck?
M5020_S0040_G0140_001_a2b=This is a waste of time.
M5020_S0040_G0150_001_a9s=You got that right.
M5020_S0040_G0160_001_a9s=Hello, <SARU_JAN>. Do you have a moment?
M5020_S0040_G0170_001_sarutoru=Moments are transitory. One cannot possess them.
M5020_S0040_G0180_001_sarutoru=A moment passed is a moment lost; a symbol of idle, unrestrained apathy that—
M5020_S0040_G0185_001_a9s=I have another gift for you...
M5020_S0040_G0190_001_a9s=Can you please just take this present already?
M5020_S0040_G0200_001_sarutoru=A gift? Let me see.
M5020_S0040_G0210_001_a9s=Here you go.
M5020_S0040_G0220_001_sarutoru=Ah, yes. Fascinating...
M5020_S0040_G0230_001_a2b=The machine who gave this to us said you were both "suspicious" and "alluring."
M5020_S0040_G0240_001_sarutoru=It seems this so-called "gift" is nothing more than a piece of unadorned glass. Therefore, I can only surmise that—
M5020_S0040_G0250_001_a9s=Um, do you want us to bring a message back to the woman who gave this to you?
M5020_S0040_G0260_001_sarutoru=For a mere trifle? No.
M5020_S0040_G0270_001_a9s=Okay then.
M5020_S0040_G0280_001_a2b=Let's go.
M5020_S0040_G0290_001_sarutoru=Indeed, is there any purpose or need to the objects we find in the world? Consider, if you will, this place. Or this village. Or even myself, if such a—
M5020_S0040_G0295_001_a2b=I have another present for you...
M5020_S0040_G0300_001_a2b=We're here with a present for you.
M5020_S0040_G0310_001_sarutoru=A present? Of what sort?
M5020_S0040_G0320_001_a9s=It's a fossil. One of your followers asked us to deliver it to you.
M5020_S0040_G0330_001_sarutoru=I see, I see.
M5020_S0040_G0340_001_a2b=She said you were "indescribably passionate" when it came to learning. Or something like that.
M5020_S0040_G0350_001_sarutoru=A mechanical fossil. No use at all.
M5020_S0040_G0360_001_a9s=Do you want us to tell her anything on your behalf, or...
M5020_S0040_G0370_001_sarutoru=I'll not waste words on mere junk.
M5020_S0040_G0380_001_a9s=Junk\!?
M5020_S0040_G0390_001_a2b=......
M5020_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=<SARU_JAN> doesn't seem to appreciate these presents he's getting.
M5020_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=I suppose we should go tell his followers exactly what he thinks of them, huh?
M5020_S0050_G0020_001_a9s=They'll be waiting for some kind of reply.
M5020_S0060_G0000_001_robogirl=There you are\! Well? What did the master have to say about my letter?
M5020_S0060_G0010_001_a9s=Actually, he said it wasn't worthy of a response.
M5020_S0060_G0020_001_robogirl=I KNEW it\! Isn't he the greatest? I can't get enough of him.
M5020_S0060_G0030_001_a9s=You don't say...
M5020_S0060_G0040_001_robogirl=Did you give my gift to Master <SARU_JAN>?
M5020_S0060_G0050_001_robogirl=I must know what he said\!
M5020_S0060_G0060_001_a9s=Well, he said it was a mere trifle.
M5020_S0060_G0070_001_robogirl=Such insight\! Such truth\! He sees to the core of things in a way others cannot\!
M5020_S0060_G0080_001_robogirl=I shall follow you for the rest of my days, Master <SARU_JAN>\!
M5020_S0060_G0090_001_a9s=That's a long time.
M5020_S0060_G0100_001_robogirl=You there\! Delivery boy\! Pray tell what Master <SARU_JAN> thought of my present.
M5020_S0060_G0110_001_a9s=He called it a useless piece of junk.
M5020_S0060_G0120_001_robogirl=Such cruelty\! I've barely the words for it\!
M5020_S0060_G0130_001_robogirl=When I think about his wanton sadism, it makes me... Oooooooh.
M5020_S0060_G0140_001_a9s=......
M5020_S0070_G0000_001_a9s=This is exhausting.
M5020_S0070_G0010_001_a9s=<SARU_JAN> doesn't care at all about anyone but himself...
M5020_S0070_G0020_001_a9s=And yet his followers just keep talking about how great he is\!
M5020_S0070_G0030_001_a9s=What's the point of all this? And what's he even getting out of it?
M5020_S0070_G0040_001_a2b=Maybe you should ask him.
M5020_S0070_G0050_001_a9s=Hmm? Where's <SARU_JAN>?
M5020_S0070_G0060_001_n02=Oh, hey. You again.
M5020_S0070_G0070_001_n02=If you're looking for <SARU_JAN>, you're too late.
M5020_S0070_G0070_300_robogirl=I won't let those other women beat me to the punch—\nI must write Master <SARU_JAN> a new letter at once\!
M5020_S0070_G0080_001_n02=He set out on "a journey."
M5020_S0070_G0080_300_robogirl=Oh, Master <SARU_JAN>... What must I do to claim your attentions...?
M5020_S0070_G0090_001_a9s=A journey, huh?
M5020_S0070_G0090_300_robogirl=You seem quite friendly with Master <SARU_JAN>...\nSee that you don't steal him away from me\!
M5020_S0070_G0100_001_n02=Yes. He said he needed to go find himself or...something.
M5020_S0070_G0110_001_n02=Oh, but he left a letter for you. Here.
M5020_S0070_G0120_001_a9s=Well, he's nothing if not consistent. A weirdo right to the very end...
M5020_S0070_G0130_001_a9s=I wonder if all his followers being female had something to do with his weirdness. Did the human sexes interact with each other like this?
M5020_S0070_G0140_001_a2b=Who knows...
