M5040_S0010_G0000_001_robomother=Hey\! Stop right this instant\!
M5040_S0010_G0010_001_robochild=No\! Get away from me, dummy\!
M5040_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=What was all that about?
M5040_S0010_G0030_001_a2b=No idea.
M5040_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Excuse me. Can I ask what just happened?
M5040_S0010_G0050_001_robomother=Oh, this is so embarrassing\! But if you must know, I was arguing with my child.
M5040_S0010_G0060_001_a2b=You don't say.
M5040_S0010_G0070_001_robomother=That boy just refuses to listen to me, and now he's gone and run off to who knows where\!
M5040_S0010_G0080_001_robomother=This is terribly forward of me, but would you mind finding him and bringing him home?
M5040_S0010_G0090_001_robomother=I'd go myself, but I'd never survive out there on my own.
M5040_S0010_G0100_001_sele=Agree to help.
M5040_S0010_G0110_001_sele=Refuse to help.
M5040_S0010_G0120_001_a2b=We'll see what we can do.
M5040_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=Heh. Look at you, you big softie.
M5040_S0010_G0140_001_robomother=Please bring my child home. Please\!
M5040_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=So this machine "mother" has a "child," eh?
M5040_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=It's surprising to see them form familial units like that.
M5040_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=I wonder if they'll let us examine their brain circuits if we bring the kid home.
M5040_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=Your scientific curiosity is getting out of hand, 9S.
M5040_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=Joking\! I'm joking\! ...Mostly.
M5040_S0020_G0000_001_robochild=Help\! Mom\! Mommyyyyyy\!
M5040_S0020_G0010_001_a2b=Over there.
M5040_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Careful, 2B. I'm picking up hostiles.
M5040_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Easy there, little guy. It's all right. You weren't scared, were you?
M5040_S0020_G0040_001_robochild=Nnngh... *sniff*
M5040_S0020_G0050_001_a2b=We should leave before more enemies arrive.
M5040_S0020_G0060_001_robochild=No\! I'm not going back\! I'm NEVER going back\!
M5040_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=Come on, kid. Don't be unreasonable.
M5040_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=Any ideas, 2B? I've never dealt with a snot-nosed machine before.
M5040_S0020_G0090_001_a2b=You got me.
M5040_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=Uh oh. More enemies incoming\!
M5040_S0020_G0110_001_a2b=I'm on it.
M5040_S0020_G0120_001_robochild=Mommy only ever praises my big brother\!
M5040_S0020_G0130_001_robochild=My little brother broke a plate once and she blamed ME for it\!
M5040_S0020_G0140_001_robochild=My big brother punched me, but somehow it was MY fault\!
M5040_S0020_G0150_001_robochild=It's not fair\!
M5040_S0020_G0160_001_robochild=I hate my mommy\!
M5040_S0020_G0170_001_robochild=I HATE her\!
M5040_S0020_G0180_001_robochild=Stupid mom...
M5040_S0020_G0190_001_a9s=Are you finished?
M5040_S0020_G0200_001_robochild=......
M5040_S0020_G0210_001_a9s=Your mother is worried about you. She sent us here to find you.
M5040_S0020_G0220_001_a9s=So quit with the whining and let us take you home already.
M5040_S0020_G0230_001_robochild=...'Kay.
M5040_S0020_G0231_001_a9s=Huh? I don't see that little machine anywhere.
M5040_S0020_G0232_001_a2b=We must have lost him somewhere.
M5040_S0020_G0233_001_a9s=He may have gone back to where we first found him.\nLet's look around.
M5040_S0020_G0240_001_a2b=Oh. That's...unfortunate.
M5040_S0020_G0250_001_a9s=Yeah, this is rough. Better go tell Mom what happened.
M5040_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=Stay close, all right? Don't go wandering off.
M5040_S0030_G0010_001_robochild=Hey, mister? Was Mommy really worried about me?
M5040_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=She sure was. So let's go home and have you apologize, all right?
M5040_S0030_G0030_001_robochild=......
M5040_S0040_G0000_001_robomother=Ah\! You're back\!
M5040_S0040_G0010_001_robomother=Thank you so much for bringing him home.
M5040_S0040_G0020_001_robochild=......
M5040_S0040_G0030_001_robomother=Selfish child\! How dare you make me worry like that\!
M5040_S0040_G0040_001_a9s=Um, hey...no need to get all angry about this.
M5040_S0040_G0050_001_robochild=M-Mommy? Mommy, no\! Don't cry\!
M5040_S0040_G0051_001_robomother=Do you have any idea how worried I was?
M5040_S0040_G0052_001_mama=*sniff* *sniff*
M5040_S0040_G0060_001_robochild=I'm sorry, Mommy\! Please don't cry\!
M5040_S0040_G0070_001_robomother=*sniff* I'm sorry too, my darling. I shouldn't have said that.
M5040_S0040_G0080_001_robochild=*sniff* Oh, Mommy...
M5040_S0040_G0090_001_robomother=Go on, honey. Get yourself home.
M5040_S0040_G0100_001_robomother=I have to thank these nice people for helping you.
M5040_S0040_G0110_001_robochild=Okay. Bye-bye, androids\!
M5040_S0040_G0120_001_robomother=...I swear, sometimes I think that child's mind is just a bunch of bolts rattling around an empty pail.
M5040_S0040_G0130_001_robomother=I never imagined how hard it would be to disconnect from the network.
M5040_S0040_G0140_001_robomother=We're constantly misunderstanding each other.
M5040_S0040_G0150_001_robomother=Still, on those rare occasions where we connect, it makes me so very happy.
M5040_S0040_G0160_001_a2b=I can see that.
M5040_S0040_G0170_001_robomother=Thank you again for bringing him home.
M5040_S0040_G0180_001_robomother=This isn't much, but I'd very much like you to have it.
M5040_S0040_G0190_001_a9s=Mutual understanding without a network sounds tough.
M5040_S0040_G0200_001_a2b=True. But it also seems kind of fun.
M5040_S0040_G0210_001_robomother=What happened? Where is my child?
M5040_S0040_G0220_001_a2b=I'm sorry. We couldn't save him.
M5040_S0040_G0230_001_robomother=No...
M5040_S0040_G0240_001_robomother=No no no no no...
