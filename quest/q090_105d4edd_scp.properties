M6110_S0020_G0000_001_n02=I guess swords don't go well with small bipedal units after all...
M6110_S0020_G0010_001_n02=We'll throw away our swords\! Please teach us\!
M6110_S0030_G0000_001_n02=Man, laser guns are so friggin' AWESOME\!\!\nI'm so glad I got myself modded\!

M6110_S0065_G0020_001_n02=He's a big machine, so he should be easy enough to find.

M6110_S0120_G0010_001_n02=Wow, that guy's really strong\! He must have a bit of 9S in him...

M6110_S0220_G0010_001_n02=...What he said.
M6110_S0230_G0000_001_n02=Hey, you. You didn't buy anything in the lobby, did ya?
M6110_S0230_G0010_001_n02=You know that guy selling stuff in the lobby?\nHe's an expert fighter.
M6110_S0230_G0020_001_n02=He's been stealing parts from the opponents he defeated to sell them and buy upgrades for himself.
M6110_S0230_G0030_001_n02=He's been tinkering with his ego backup data as well, and I think he's started to get a bit loopy...
M6110_S0230_G0040_001_n02=You may not have noticed, but you actually fought him before.
M6110_S0230_G0050_001_n02=Thanks for taking care of him. And congrats\!
