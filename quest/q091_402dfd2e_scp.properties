M5091_S0010_G0250_001_a2b=Huh. This is unexpected.
M5091_S0010_G0260_001_a9s=Oh my gosh...
M5091_S0010_G0270_001_a2=...Really?

M5091_S0020_G0010_001_reception=In that case, welcome to the ultimate in entertainment\! A place where androids and machines risk their lives in combat\!
M5091_S0020_G0020_001_reception=And yes, it's technically against Resistance regulations, but everyone needs a way to blow off some steam, am I right?
M5091_S0020_G0030_001_reception=Please let me know if you'd like to participate.
M5091_S0020_G0040_001_reception=Care to join the fray?

M5091_S0020_G0110_001_reception=Battles here are separated into six distinct ranks. They start at E, then move up through D, C, B, A, and finally S.
M5091_S0020_G0120_001_reception=As a beginner, you can participate only in E-level matches.
M5091_S0020_G0130_001_reception=Once you win, you'll earn the right to join the next tier.
M5091_S0020_G0140_001_reception=The higher you advance, the greater the prizes you can win.
M5091_S0020_G0145_001_reception=And that's about all there's to it\!
M5091_S0020_G0155_001_reception=Oh by the way, you are not allowed to use items in the arena\!
M5091_S0020_G0157_001_reception=Can't have a bunch of weaklings try to bulldoze their way through without any strategy, can we?
M5091_S0030_G0000_001_moderator=We're ready to kick off a new E-rank battle\!
M5091_S0030_G0010_001_moderator=Don't let the low rank fool you—if you lower your guard, you'll be scrap.
M5091_S0030_G0010_300_moderator=That's all she wrote, folks\!
M5091_S0030_G0020_001_moderator=Now...let the battle begin\!
M5091_S0030_G0020_300_reception=Tough luck. But don't let it stop you—just try, try again\!

M5091_S0030_G0052_001_reception=It's nice to change your hair color every once in a while, you know?
M5091_S0030_G0054_001_reception=We have to look for little things like that to distract us from our everyday lives.
M5091_S0030_G0056_001_reception=Otherwise we'll all go insane, what with the constant fighting going on.
M5091_S0030_G0058_001_reception=...I'm sorry, I was just rambling a bit. Come visit again, okay?
M5091_S0030_G0060_001_andman=Hey, your gears rusted or something? Hurry up already\!

M5091_S0030_G0080_001_andman=Bah\! You're useless. I oughta trade you in and be done with it...
M5091_S0030_G0085_001_andman=This hunk of junk REALLY doesn't want to fight anymore for some reason...
M5091_S0030_G0090_001_moderator=It's time to kick off this D-rank match, folks\!
M5091_S0030_G0100_001_moderator=Er, I mean, once I say to begin, we'll kick it off. We won't start during the explanation of how to start... I'm making this very confusing.
M5091_S0030_G0100_300_reception=Which rank do you want to attempt?
M5091_S0030_G0110_001_moderator=Uh, yeah. Anyway. This is for real. Now fight\!

M5091_S0030_G0230_001_andmanC=I think someone crossed your circuits.
M5091_S0030_G0250_001_andmanC=Better tear you apart and see what's wrong.
M5091_S0030_G0260_001_robowoman=NO. NO\! NOOOOOO\!
M5091_S0030_G0270_001_moderator=Are you ready for another feast of oil, gears, and blood?
M5091_S0030_G0280_001_moderator=Then welcome...to the B-rank stage\!
M5091_S0030_G0290_001_moderator=Let the fists fly\! Let the feet kick\! Let the pure passion of combat come forth in glorious... Er, sorry. I'm rambling again, aren't I?
M5091_S0030_G0300_001_moderator=Fine then. Fiiight\!

M5091_S0030_G0390_001_andmanC=Huh? Did you go with a new model out there?
M5091_S0030_G0400_001_andmanD=Yeah, I kicked my old one a few too many times and it finally fell apart.
M5091_S0030_G0410_001_andmanC=Probably not gentle kicks either, knowing you.
M5091_S0030_G0420_001_andmanD=Who gives a rip? It's that dumb machine's fault for being such a piece of crap.
M5091_S0030_G0430_001_andmanD=Not like I can't just get another one.
M5091_S0030_G0440_001_moderator=Warriors of the S-rank...
M5091_S0030_G0450_001_moderator=Today, I want to see you revel in the glorious and refined combat arts...

M5091_S0030_G0500_001_a2b=What's this?
M5091_S0030_G0510_001_a9s=What's this?
M5091_S0030_G0520_001_a2=What the\!?
M5091_S0030_G0530_001_reception=This is a piece of "revealing women's clothing" that humans used to wear.
M5091_S0030_G0540_001_reception=With clothing like this, you have to wonder why they even bothered wearing anything in the first place, eh?
M5091_S0030_G0550_001_reception=That's humans for ya. Anyway, take it. It's yours.
M5091_S0030_G0600_001_andmanA=Har har\! I haven't laughed this hard in ages\!
M5091_S0030_G0610_001_andwomanA=Can you believe these things are so dumb they think they're actually alive\!?

M5091_S0030_G0630_001_robowoman=HOW COULD ANYONE DO SUCH A THING?
M5091_S0030_G0640_001_andmanC=I took your mother apart because she needed fixin'\!
M5091_S0030_G0650_001_andmanC=It doesn't look like I'll be able to put her back together again, though.
M5091_S0030_G0660_001_andmanC=What? What are you looking at me like that for?
M5091_S0030_G0670_001_andmanC=If you got nothing to say, get the hell outta my face.
M5091_S0030_G0680_001_resi=Machines crying over their "mothers"...
M5091_S0030_G0690_001_resi=It's bloody disgusting, is what it is.
M5091_S0030_G0700_001_resi=Hey, you wanna join in on the fun?
M5091_S0030_G0710_001_resi=Whatever, we don't need your holier-than-thou attitude. Get outta here.
M5091_S0030_G0720_001_resi=Quit yer yappin' and get fightin' already, you stupid piece of junk.
M5091_S0030_G0725_001_resi=I MUST ESCAPE THIS HELL...
M5091_S0030_G0730_001_resi=I want to see these bastards suffer over and over\!
M5091_S0030_G0738_001_n02=*sniff* MOMMY... HELP ME... PLEASE...
M5091_S0030_G0740_001_n02=MOMMY... MOMMY...
M5091_S0030_G0750_001_andmanC=I should probably get a new machine one of these days.
M5091_S0030_G0760_001_andmanC=One that cries even more, preferably.
M5091_S0030_G0770_001_andmanD=Lessee, what ordeals shall I put my little robot through next?
M5091_S0030_G0780_001_andmanD=It's gotta make up for screwing up the planet like this, am I right?
M5091_S0040_G0000_001_reception=Talk about exciting, by the way\! I haven't seen a battle like that in forever.
M5091_S0040_G0010_001_reception=Hey, you want to see something interesting?
M5091_S0040_G0012_001_reception=Have a look back there. You'll love it\!
M5091_S0040_G0014_001_reception=Hey, come on now\! I'm letting you have a look\! Don't be rude\!
M5091_S0040_G0016_001_a2b=Huh. This is unexpected.
M5091_S0040_G0017_001_a9s=Oh my gosh...
M5091_S0040_G0018_001_a2=...Really?
M5091_S0040_G0019_001_n02=Help me... Help me...
M5091_S0040_G0020_001_resi=Now then... Which one should I choose next?
M5091_S0040_G0030_001_n02=EEP...\!
M5091_S0040_G0040_001_resi=Ha ha\! Stupid machines. Look at 'em quaking in their boots or...whatever they have. I love it\!
M5091_S0040_G0050_001_a2b=......
M5091_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=......
M5091_S0040_G0070_001_a2=......
M5091_S0040_G0080_001_resi=These little bastards killed 8 of my subordinates\!
M5091_S0040_G0085_001_resi=Every Resistance member here lost someone important because of the machines.
M5091_S0040_G0087_001_resi=Some saw their loved ones cut to pieces, others had their friends eaten right in front of their eyes.
M5091_S0040_G0088_001_resi=Do you blame us for getting together in a place like this?
M5091_S0040_G0090_001_resi=I'm thinking of taking a few of these guys and dunking 'em in water. Might be fun to watch the sparks fly.
M5091_S0040_G0100_001_resi=A little light-show might be just what the mechanic ordered...
M5091_S0040_G0110_001_resi=Well? You up for it?
M5091_S0040_G0120_001_a2b=Pass.
M5091_S0040_G0130_001_a9s=N-no, I'm good, thanks.
M5091_S0040_G0140_001_a2=No. Hell no.
M5091_S0040_G0150_001_resi=Aw, come on\! Don't be such an old lump of iron\!
M5091_S0040_G0160_001_resi=You didn't forget your bloodlust when you were trashing these guys earlier, right?
M5091_S0040_G0170_001_resi=Well, this is the same deal.
M5091_S0040_G0180_001_resi=Only difference is whether you kill 'em here or kill 'em on your missions, you know?
M5091_S0040_G0190_001_resi=Eh, whatever. This is wasted on you.
M5091_S0040_G0200_001_pod042=Analysis\: The androids in this arena are exhibiting unusual emotional depth.
M5091_S0040_G0210_001_pod042=Hypothesis\: They have begun to inherit the cruelty inherent in humanity.
M5091_S0040_G0220_001_a2b=...Huh.

M5091_S0040_G0260_001_pod042=Analysis\: The androids in this arena are exhibiting unusual emotional depth.
M5091_S0040_G0270_001_pod042=Hypothesis\: They have begun to inherit the cruelty inherent in humanity.
M5091_S0040_G0280_001_a2=...I see.
M5091_S0055_G0000_001_reception=We prepared a special new rank for you\! Hope you like lots of pain\!
M5091_S0055_G0010_001_reception=This is meant to test your actual skills, so your auto-chips will be disabled.
M5091_S0055_G0020_001_reception=This is your chance to show the world what you're truly made of\!
M5091_S0060_G0000_001_moderator=Hmmm. So you made it this far, huh?
M5091_S0060_G0010_001_moderator=Alright, then I think you're ready to face the next challenge\!

M5091_S0065_G0020_001_reception=The time you took to complete this battle is\: <time>.
M5091_S0065_G0030_001_reception=I'm sure you can do better\!
M5091_S0070_G0000_001_secretary=Hello, can I help you?

M5091_S0070_G0050_001_secretary=Yes? Is there anything else you require?
M5091_S0070_G0060_001_secretary=I'm sorry, I'm not authorized to make that decision.
M5091_S0070_G0070_001_secretary=Okay, I'm going to ask again, because I'm nice\: IS there something I can help you with?
M5091_S0070_G0080_001_secretary=Alright, if you insist. But I have to warn you\: what you're about to see may end up destroying your sense of immersion. Are you okay with that?
M5091_S0070_G0090_001_secretary=I think that's a wise decision.
M5091_S0070_G0100_001_secretary=Are you REALLY super duper sure you want to do this? This is your last chance to back out\!
