M5110_S0010_G0000_001_roboane=Excuse me? Do you have a moment?
M5110_S0010_G0001_300_sister=Thank you for bringing my sister home.
M5110_S0010_G0002_300_sister=I'm feeling much better thanks to the part she found.
M5110_S0010_G0003_300_youngsister=Thanks for helping me search earlier\!
M5110_S0010_G0004_300_youngsister=I promise not to make my sister worry any more.
M5110_S0010_G0007_300_sister=Please, take this...
M5110_S0010_G0010_001_roboane=Please, I need your help\!
M5110_S0010_G0020_001_roboane=Um, excuse me? Can you please help me? I need to find my little sister. She's lost.
M5110_S0010_G0021_001_sele=Agree to help look for her.
M5110_S0010_G0022_001_sele=Refuse to help.
M5110_S0010_G0030_001_roboane=And it's all my fault...
M5110_S0010_G0040_001_roboane=It seems she overheard me complaining about how one of my parts was starting to seize up.
M5110_S0010_G0050_001_roboane=So she went off to the desert in search of a replacement.
M5110_S0010_G0060_001_roboane=It's been days now, and she's still not back. Please, you have to help me\! I'll pay you whatever you want\!
M5110_S0010_G0070_001_roboane=Can you please help me find my little sister? She's lost in the desert\!
M5110_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=She sure cares about her little sister, huh?
M5110_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=Still, it's pretty funny to hear machines talk about siblings.
M5110_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Do you think she just means they were built at the same factory or something?
M5110_S0010_G0110_001_a2b=Maybe.
M5110_S0020_G0000_001_pascal=Um, hello there\! Hello? Testing testing?
M5110_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Er, Pascal? Is that you?
M5110_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=Ah\! 9S\! Yes, it is me. Many apologies for the sudden transmission.
M5110_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=I heard that you were searching for the missing child, yes?
M5110_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=Well, if you would, please consider this a personal request from myself as well. Go find the child as quickly as you can\!
M5110_S0020_G0050_001_pascal=She's such a good little girl, and so fond of her sister\!
M5110_S0020_G0060_001_pascal=She's probably somewhere around the desert at the moment.
M5110_S0020_G0070_001_pascal=That's where she's likely to find the dented plate her sister needs.
M5110_S0020_G0080_001_a2b=Got it.
M5110_S0020_G0090_001_pascal=Thank you so much. And please be careful, all right?
M5110_S0030_G0000_001_roboimouto=I wanna go hoooome... Siiiiisteeeeer\! Where are you\!?
M5110_S0030_G0001_001_a9s=Is that...?
M5110_S0030_G0010_001_roboimouto=Nnngh... *sniff*
M5110_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Hey there. Are you the machine who came out here looking for a spare part?
M5110_S0030_G0030_001_roboimouto=Huh? Who are you?
M5110_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=Your sister asked us to look for you.
M5110_S0030_G0050_001_roboimouto=...She did? Really?
M5110_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=Really. So what do you say we head home?
M5110_S0030_G0070_001_roboimouto=Waaaaaaaah\! I was soooo scaaaaaared\!
M5110_S0030_G0080_001_a2b=Right. Let's get her back to Pascal's village.
M5110_S0030_G0090_001_a9s=How'd you get lost out here, anyway?
M5110_S0030_G0110_001_roboimouto=I was looking for my sister's part...
M5110_S0030_G0120_001_roboimouto=But then I got scared and I couldn't move and...and...and... Waaaaah\!
M5110_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=Aw, come on now, don't cry\!
M5110_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=Did you at least find what you needed?
M5110_S0030_G0150_001_roboimouto=Y-Yeah. *sniff* She'll be happy, right?
M5110_S0030_G0160_001_a9s=I'm sure she will. But I bet she'll be even happier to see you back home safe and sound.
M5110_S0030_G0170_001_roboimouto=...'Kay.
M5110_S0030_G0180_001_a2b=9S? Where's the girl?
M5110_S0030_G0190_001_a9s=Huh? Oh, hell\!
M5110_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=We must have gotten separated somehow.
M5110_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=Let's go back to where we first found her. I bet she's waiting there.
M5110_S0030_G0220_001_roboimouto=WAAAAAAAAAAAAH\! YOU LEFT MEEEEEEEE\!
M5110_S0030_G0230_001_roboimouto=You guys walk too fast. *sniff*
M5110_S0030_G0240_001_a9s=Sorry\! Sorry. We'll try to walk slower, okay?
M5110_S0030_G0250_001_roboimouto=Hey, mister? Why'd they make the desert?
M5110_S0030_G0260_001_a9s=No one "made" the desert. It's just an area that lost all its vegetation due to a lack of precipitation.
M5110_S0030_G0270_001_a9s=This caused lasting changes in the soil, which means plants aren't able to—
M5110_S0030_G0280_001_roboimouto=What's "soil"?
M5110_S0030_G0290_001_a9s=Soil? Uh, it's dirt. Ground. The stuff we're walking on?
M5110_S0030_G0300_001_roboimouto=Oooooooo\! I like ground.
M5110_S0030_G0310_001_roboimouto=Hey, mister? Where does the wind blow from?
M5110_S0030_G0320_001_a9s=Wind is just a force caused by changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure and...
M5110_S0030_G0330_001_a9s=Huh. That's actually a hard question, now that I think about it.
M5110_S0030_G0340_001_a9s=Kind of deep, really. I mean, where does the wind blow from? What do you think, 2B?
M5110_S0030_G0350_001_a2b=Don't know. Don't care.
M5110_S0030_G0360_001_roboimouto=Hey, mister? How do you make children?
M5110_S0030_G0370_001_a9s=Uuuuuuum....
M5110_S0030_G0380_001_a9s=Well, machines can't really make children. Neither can androids, now that I think about it.
M5110_S0030_G0390_001_roboimouto=Yeah, but how DO you make 'em?
M5110_S0030_G0400_001_a9s=Uh, 2B? Little help here?
M5110_S0030_G0410_001_a2b=Huh? You're the chatty one. Work it out.
M5110_S0030_G0420_001_a9s=Ooof.
M5110_S0030_G0430_001_roboimouto=Mister\! Mister, wait\! You gotta tell me how you make chil—
M5110_S0030_G0440_001_a9s=Wow, it's getting late\! Let's get you home already\!
M5110_S0040_G0000_001_roboimouto=Hey, I know this place\! I can get home by myself now.
M5110_S0040_G0010_001_roboimouto=Thanks, mister\! Thanks, grumpy lady\! Oh, and here. You can have this.
M5110_S0040_G0020_001_roboimouto=Bye-byeeeeee\!
M5110_S0040_G0030_001_roboimouto=Make sure to come back and tell me how to make childreeeeeeen\!
M5110_S0040_G0040_001_a9s=......
M5110_S0040_G0050_001_a2b=......
M5110_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=Well, that was exhausting.
M5110_S0040_G0070_001_a2b=Yep.
