M5120_S0010_G0000_001_toolshop=Welcome, welcome\! It's always great to get new customers.
M5120_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=You some kind of supply trader for the Resistance?
M5120_S0010_G0020_001_toolshop=You know it. Every item here is hand-crafted from abandoned parts and stuff plundered from enemy corpses.
M5120_S0010_G0030_001_toolshop=So then\! To business. What can I get you?
M5120_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Do you sell plug-in chips?
M5120_S0010_G0050_001_toolshop=You mean those little doo-dads that serve as power-ups for your body? 'Fraid not.
M5120_S0010_G0060_001_toolshop=I'd love to sell plug-in chips, but I don't have the necessary raw materials.
M5120_S0010_G0070_001_toolshop=Now, if I happened to GET those raw materials, I bet we could do business. But until then...
M5120_S0010_G0080_001_toolshop=Say\! Now there's an idea\: what if YOU got the materials for me?
M5120_S0010_G0090_001_toolshop=I've got this bum leg, see? Can't really get around myself.
M5120_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Can't you just repair your own leg? You work in the supply trade, after all.
M5120_S0010_G0110_001_toolshop=If only\! Unfortunately, all of our parts are dedicated to the war effort. Can't spare any for myself.
M5120_S0010_G0120_001_toolshop=Personally, I'm hoping you wipe out those machines so I can start dancing again. But until then, will you look for what I need?
M5120_S0010_G0130_001_sele=Agree to help.
M5120_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Refuse to help.
M5120_S0010_G0150_001_a2b=All right.
M5120_S0010_G0160_001_toolshop=Aw, thanks a million\!
M5120_S0010_G0170_001_toolshop=Okay, so I need one broken key, one small gear, and one broken circuit. You can smash up a few small machines to find 'em.
M5120_S0010_G0175_001_toolshop=You can obtain them from enemies at the big open area towards the left when you exit the camp.
M5120_S0010_G0180_001_toolshop=Hey, I get it. You're probably busy with the killin' and whatnot. Maybe next time.
M5120_S0010_G0190_001_toolshop=If you've got the time, can you help me find some raw materials?
M5120_S0010_G0200_001_toolshop=I need one broken key, one small gear, and one broken circuit. Donâ€™t forget\!
M5120_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Okay, that's everything the supply trader asked for.
M5120_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Man, these chores are a real pain in the butt, huh?
M5120_S0020_G0020_001_a2b=The Resistance is a valuable ally to YoRHa.
M5120_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=By helping them, we also help ourselves.
M5120_S0020_G0040_001_a2b=So no. I don't think they're a pain.
M5120_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=Yeah, yeah...
M5120_S0030_G0000_001_toolshop=Hey, you found the materials\! That's great.
M5120_S0030_G0010_001_toolshop=Now I can start upgrading and crafting items for you.
M5120_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=I imagine you can spare a few of these supplies to fix your leg?
M5120_S0030_G0030_001_toolshop=Yeaaaaaah...no.
M5120_S0030_G0040_001_a2b=Why don't you tell us what's really going on.
M5120_S0030_G0050_001_toolshop=See, it's my left leg that's all busted up. And my left leg is the one that's fully original.
M5120_S0030_G0060_001_toolshop=I've repaired this ol' body of mine a hundred times over during this war.
M5120_S0030_G0070_001_toolshop=I've swapped parts in and out so many times I can't even keep track.
M5120_S0030_G0080_001_toolshop=But this leg? This left leg? It's never been touched.
M5120_S0030_G0090_001_toolshop=So if I go and replace that, what happens?
M5120_S0030_G0100_001_toolshop=I mean, would I even be ME anymore? Or would I just...
M5120_S0030_G0110_001_a2b=......
M5120_S0030_G0120_001_toolshop=Anyway, it's my own problem. Didn't mean to trouble you with it.
M5120_S0030_G0130_001_toolshop=I should be getting more inventory soon, so swing by when you can.
M5920_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
M5920_S0020_G0280_001_pod153=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
