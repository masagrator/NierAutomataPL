M5121_S0010_G0000_001_ane=......
M5121_S0010_G0000_300_manager=Did you find the music box I asked you about?
M5121_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=What's wrong, Anemone?
M5121_S0010_G0010_300_manager=Sorry, but can you come back later?
M5121_S0010_G0020_001_ane=We've been falling behind on our material-storage work as of late.
M5121_S0010_G0020_300_manager=I can't just sit here while everyone's fighting so hard around me. I need to shape up...
M5121_S0010_G0030_001_ane=The person in charge is usually quite reliable, but lately...
M5121_S0010_G0040_001_ane=Well, to be blunt, she's been slacking. I think there's some kind of personal issue distracting her.
M5121_S0010_G0050_001_ane=I don't know the whole story, but I'm going to have to find out so this doesn't disrupt our operation any more than it already has.
M5121_S0010_G0051_001_ane=You can find the person in charge on top of the scaffolding at the back of the camp.
M5121_S0010_G0052_001_ane=Would you mind talking to him?
M5121_S0010_G0060_001_manager=*sigh* Why can't I stop thinking about it...?
M5121_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=Stop thinking about what?
M5121_S0010_G0080_001_manager=Gya\! What\!? Who are you\!?
M5121_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=We're with YoRHa.
M5121_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Anemone told us to make ourselves at home.
M5121_S0010_G0110_001_manager=Oh...r-right.
M5121_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=So. What can't you stop thinking about?
M5121_S0010_G0130_001_manager=Oh, it's just... One of my friends has a box that makes music when you open it, and I can't get the damn song out of my head.
M5121_S0010_G0140_001_manager=It's just so beautiful\! I've never heard anything like it\!
M5121_S0010_G0150_001_manager=And to make it worse, I can only remember the first part of the song...
M5121_S0010_G0160_001_manager=Daaah, it's driving me nuts\!
M5121_S0010_G0170_001_manager=I wish she'd just come back to camp so I could hear the damn thing again\!
M5121_S0010_G0180_001_sele=Go look for the missing item.
M5121_S0010_G0190_001_sele=Let the weirdo work it out herself.
M5121_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=Yeah, if we don't help her, she'll never get any work done.
M5121_S0010_G0210_001_a2b=A box that plays sound? Odd.
M5121_S0010_G0220_001_pod042=Analysis\: The item in question is likely a "music box." It should be located in an area where music is playing.
M5121_S0010_G0230_001_pod042=Proposal\: The local amusement park would be a logical area for reconnaissance.
M5121_S0010_G0240_001_a9s=That's some fuzzy logic there, Pod...
M5121_S0010_G0250_001_a9s=But hey, might as well try it. Not like we have any other leads to go on.
M5121_S0010_G0260_001_a9s=Is this the "music box" she was looking for?
M5121_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=Man, this thing is all rusted over...
M5121_S0010_G0280_001_a2b=Look. A corpse.
M5121_S0010_G0290_001_a9s=You think the box belonged to her?
M5121_S0010_G0300_001_a9s=Poor girl died a long time ago, by the looks of it.
M5121_S0010_G0310_001_a2b=Let's bring this back to her friend.
M5121_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=Excuse me. Is this the "music box" you were looking for?
M5121_S0030_G0010_001_manager=THAT'S IT\! Where did you find it?
M5121_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=In the amusement park, next to the corpse of an android. Maybe that was its owner?
M5121_S0030_G0030_001_manager=...Oh.
M5121_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=Was she...
M5121_S0030_G0050_001_manager=......
M5121_S0030_G0060_001_manager=Well, it's awfully rusty, but with a little work I should be able to get it playing again.
M5121_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=Of course.
M5121_S0030_G0080_001_manager=Thank you for bringing the box to me.
M5121_S0030_G0090_001_manager=Now I can finally concentrate on my work again\!
M5121_S0030_G0100_001_manager=Oh, and you two are welcome to enter the back anytime you like from now on.
