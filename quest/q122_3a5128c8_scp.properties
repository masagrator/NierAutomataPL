M5122_S0010_G0000_001_ane=Oh, hello. Your timing is excellent.
M5122_S0010_G0000_300_ane=Sorry, but could you focus on your mission for now?
M5122_S0010_G0010_001_ane=I need a favor from you both.
M5122_S0010_G0010_300_ane=I know you came here and everything, but...
M5122_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=What is it?
M5122_S0010_G0030_001_ane=We're planning a recon expedition of the forest region.
M5122_S0010_G0040_001_ane=But before we can start, we need someone to head in there and set up a satellite camp.
M5122_S0010_G0050_001_ane=The enemies are tough, and I'd lose a lot of good people if we tried to clear them out. But you two seem like you can handle yourselves, so...
M5122_S0010_G0060_001_a2b=Got it. Head to the woods and clear out any enemies.
M5122_S0010_G0070_001_ane=That's the long and short of it, yes. Thank you.
M5122_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=...Looks like that's the last of them. Good work.
M5122_S0010_G0130_001_a2b=The Resistance should be able to set up camp now.
M5122_S0010_G0140_001_a9s=Right\! Let's head back and give 'em the good news.
M5122_S0030_G0000_001_ane=Looks like we're cleared to set up in the forest. Thank you.
M5122_S0030_G0030_001_ane=I'll let you know if we need anything further.
M5123_S0010_G0000_001_ane=Seriously, you YoRHa types are something else.
M5123_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Well, not to brag, but we ARE state-of-the-art units. Not like the A2 or those other old mode—
M5123_S0010_G0020_001_ane=A2?
M5123_S0010_G0030_001_ane=Attacker Number 2?
M5123_S0010_G0040_001_a2b=You know her?
M5123_S0010_G0050_001_ane=No, not...
M5123_S0010_G0060_001_ane=......
M5123_S0010_G0070_001_ane=I'm sorry. Can I ask one more favor of you?
M5123_S0010_G0080_001_ane=Can you give me any information you have on that old A2 YoRHa unit? Anything at all.
M5123_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=That's funny—we've been trying to find more information ourselves. Why are you asking?
M5123_S0010_G0100_001_ane=I just...need to be sure about something.
M5920_S0060_G0210_001_a9s=I know it's our job and all, but these Resistance types sure do use and abuse us, don't they?
M5920_S0060_G0220_001_a9s=It's like they see us as a couple of gofers or something.
M5920_S0060_G0230_001_a2b=No complaining about your work.
M5920_S0060_G0240_001_a2b=Exchanging information with the Resistance is a vital part of our mission.
M5920_S0060_G0250_001_a2b=Besides, being a gofer is safer than being locked in combat all the time.
M5920_S0060_G0260_001_a2b=Not dying beats dying any day.
M5920_S0060_G0270_001_a9s=Yeah, that's true.
