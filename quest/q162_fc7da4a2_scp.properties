M5162_S0000_G0000_300_op60=Thanks in advance for investigating that access point that went dark.
M5162_S0010_G0000_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B. Come in, 2B.
M5162_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=2B here.
M5162_S0010_G0020_001_op60=The monitoring signal from the new access point has gone silent.
M5162_S0010_G0030_001_op60=I'm sending you the positional data. Please investigate the site as soon as possible.
M5162_S0010_G0040_001_a2b=Understood.
M5162_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=We've got company. Looks like machines.
M5162_S0010_G0060_001_pod042=Alert\: Jamming signals detected from enemy units.
M5162_S0010_G0070_001_a2b=Yeah?
M5162_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=That's not good.
M5162_S0010_G0090_001_pod042=Enemy machine lifeforms eliminated. Access point returned to functioning status.
M5162_S0010_G0100_001_cmd=Bunker to 2B.
M5162_S0010_G0110_001_cmd=The signal from the access point just came back online. Good job.
M5162_S0010_G0120_001_a2b=I have some information about that, Commander.
M5162_S0010_G0130_001_cmd=Go on.
M5162_S0010_G0140_001_a2b=The access point went offline because machine lifeforms were jamming it.
M5162_S0010_G0150_001_cmd=Which means they know that facility is one of our network terminals...
M5162_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=Yeah, but that's not all. While they knew it was connected to our network, they didn't try to destroy it.
M5162_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=It's almost like they were trying to lay a trap.
M5162_S0010_G0180_001_cmd=Damn... They're getting smarter by the day.
M5162_S0010_G0190_001_cmd=Thank you. I'll be sure to share this with the Council of Humanity on the moon.
M5162_S0010_G0200_001_a2b=Understood.
