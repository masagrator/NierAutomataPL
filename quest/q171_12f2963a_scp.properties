M5171_S0010_G0000_001_a2b=Pod?
M5171_S0010_G0010_001_pod042=Understood.
M5171_S0010_G0020_001_a2b=I didn't say anything yet.
M5171_S0010_G0030_001_pod042=The conversation between Operator 6O and unit 2B has been analyzed.
M5171_S0010_G0040_001_pod042=Hypothesis\: Unit 2B wishes to send Operator 6O a gift from the surface so that she might be able to experience it in some fashion.
M5171_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=...That's right.
M5171_S0010_G0060_001_pod042=Proposal\: The gift should be a photograph of a rare flower.
M5171_S0010_G0070_001_a2b=You think?
M5171_S0010_G0080_001_pod042=Analysis of historical data indicates that human females enjoyed viewing the reproductive organs of flowering plants.
M5171_S0010_G0090_001_pod042=If unit 2B can procure appropriate image data, it could be uploaded to the Bunker.
M5171_S0010_G0100_001_pod042=Proposal\: Unit 2B should obtain an image of the plant known as the "desert rose."
M5171_S0010_G0110_001_a2b=All right.
M5171_S0010_G0120_001_a2b=Pod, take a photograph of the desert rose and send it to Operator 6O.
M5171_S0010_G0130_001_pod042=Affirmative.
M5171_S0010_G0140_001_pod042=Image data transfer complete.
M5171_S0030_G0000_001_op60=2B, this is Operator 6O\! Pick up\!
M5171_S0030_G0010_001_a2b=2B here. Go ahead.
M5171_S0030_G0020_001_op60=Thank you so much for the picture\!
M5171_S0030_G0030_001_op60=So this is a desert rose, huh? It seems almost...mystical.
M5171_S0030_G0040_001_op60=There must just be a bounty of nature down there, huh?
M5171_S0030_G0050_001_a2b=Some, yes. I've seen lilies, cherry blossoms, daffodils, and even lunar tears.
M5171_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=I'll try to send more if I can.
M5171_S0030_G0070_001_op60=Oh, 2B...
M5171_S0030_G0080_001_op60=I'm going to treasure this forever\!
M5171_S0030_G0090_001_op60=Oh, and I'm going to send you a proper thank-you mail later, so keep an eye out for it. Bye\!
