M5210_S0010_G0000_001_n02=Oh. You're androids, yes?
M5210_S0010_G0010_001_n02=Then you must be here to kill me.
M5210_S0010_G0020_001_n02=I've lived long enough. I only ask that you not make it too painful.
M5210_S0010_G0030_001_sele=Destroy the machine.
M5210_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Spare her.
M5210_S0010_G0050_001_n02=Be quick, then.
M5210_S0010_G0060_001_n02=Why do you not strike?
M5210_S0010_G0070_001_a2b=Because you have no desire to fight.
M5210_S0010_G0080_001_a2b=You're like the machines in Pascal's village.
M5210_S0010_G0090_001_a2b=If you don't attempt to harm us, we have no cause for quarrel.
M5210_S0010_G0100_001_n02=You know Pascal? I see...
M5210_S0010_G0110_001_n02=Still, you should be careful.
M5210_S0010_G0120_001_a2b=Of what?
M5210_S0010_G0130_001_n02=Some of our kind can be violent. They are beyond our control.
M5210_S0010_G0140_001_n02=They attack everything they see, be it friend or foe.
M5210_S0010_G0150_001_n02=Many of these machines are waiting in the canyon ahead.
M5210_S0010_G0160_001_n02=You would be wise to keep your distance.
M5210_S0010_G0170_001_a2b=Machines attacking indiscriminately...
M5210_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Proposal\: Unit 2B should eliminate the hostile machines.
M5210_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Look at all the corpses. Is this some kind of graveyard?
M5210_S0020_G0010_001_a2b=Watch out\! They're still alive\!
M5210_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=I'm on it\!
M5210_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=There's more\!
M5210_S0020_G0040_001_n02=KILL... KILL...
M5210_S0020_G0050_001_n02=SUCH PAIN... KILL ME...
M5210_S0020_G0060_001_a2b=What's it saying?
M5210_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=Don't listen to it, 2B\!
M5210_S0020_G0080_001_n02=KILL...
M5210_S0020_G0090_001_n02=PLEASE...KILL...ME...
M5210_S0020_G0100_001_n02=PLEASE KILL ME.
M5210_S0020_G0110_001_a2b=What was with that thing?
M5210_S0020_G0120_001_a9s=It was talking.
M5210_S0020_G0130_001_a9s=Maybe that machine who sent us here knows something about this.
M5210_S0020_G0140_001_a9s=We should try asking her.
M5210_S0030_G0000_001_n02=Oh... It's you again.
M5210_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=We have a question about the machines in the canyon.
M5210_S0030_G0020_001_n02=Yes. Very dangerous. You should avoid them.
M5210_S0030_G0030_001_a9s=Actually, we already took care of them.
M5210_S0030_G0040_001_n02=You what\!?
M5210_S0030_G0050_001_n02=...I see. Then perhaps they can finally reach heaven.
M5210_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=Come again?
M5210_S0030_G0070_001_n02=Many machines have thrown themselves into that canyon of late.
M5210_S0030_G0080_001_n02=They were trying to hurt themselves beyond repair.
M5210_S0030_G0090_001_n02=You found the remains of those who succeeded...and fought those who did not.
M5210_S0030_G0100_001_n02=I know not what would drive them to do such a thing...
M5210_S0030_G0110_001_n02=But I pray regardless that their souls might reach heaven.
M5210_S0030_G0120_001_n02=...Here. A gift for you.
M5210_S0030_G0130_001_n02=Thank you for killing them.
M5210_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=Souls and heaven, huh?
M5210_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=Do either of those things exist?
M5210_S0030_G0160_001_a2b=They'll find out in the end.
M5210_S0030_G0170_001_a2b=And so will we.
M5210_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=Okay, that's grim.
