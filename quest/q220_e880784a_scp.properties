M5220_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Ah, A2. Can I help you with something?
M5220_S0010_G0010_001_a2=You gave me that filter for free earlier.
M5220_S0010_G0020_001_a2=I need to pay you back. It would bother me otherwise.
M5220_S0010_G0030_001_pascal=How conscientious of you\!
M5220_S0010_G0040_001_a2=Yeah. So if you think of something, let me know.
M5220_S0010_G0050_001_pascal=I do have a bit of a problem, now that you mention it.
M5220_S0010_G0060_001_pascal=A ferocious machine has been attacking our children in the area where they play.
M5220_S0010_G0070_001_pascal=Could I possibly trouble you to slay it for us?
M5220_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=I do hope you'll agree. We don't really have anyone else to ask.
M5220_S0010_G0090_001_sele=Agree to help.
M5220_S0010_G0100_001_sele=Refuse.
M5220_S0010_G0110_001_pascal=O-Of course. I know you have your own priorities.
M5220_S0010_G0120_001_pascal=It was rude to even ask. Please forgive me.
M5220_S0010_G0130_001_pascal=Will you slay the terrible machine that attacks our children while they play?
M5220_S0010_G0140_001_pascal=Thank you so much\!
M5220_S0010_G0150_001_pascal=I promise to repay you for the trouble.
M5220_S0010_G0160_001_pascal=Please slay the terrible machine that attacks our children while they play.
M5220_S0010_G0170_001_pascal=You have my thanks.
M5220_S0020_G0005_001_pod042=Hostile machine lifeformｓ detected.
M5220_S0030_G0000_001_pascal=We heard you defeated that nasty creature\!
M5220_S0030_G0010_001_pascal=Thank you so much.
M5220_S0030_G0020_001_pascal=Here is your reward. Please take it.
M5220_S0030_G0030_001_pascal=I built this village because I detest fighting. I wanted it to stand as a monument to the power of peace.
M5220_S0030_G0040_001_pascal=But when we surrendered our weapons, we lost the ability to defend ourselves.
M5220_S0030_G0050_001_pascal=Now many within the village want us to re-arm and vanquish nearby enemies in order to preserve our peace.
M5220_S0030_G0060_001_pascal=What do you think we should do, A2?
M5220_S0030_G0070_001_a2=Dunno.
M5220_S0030_G0080_001_a2=That's for you to decide.
M5220_S0030_G0090_001_pascal=Yes, I suppose so.
M5220_S0030_G0100_001_a2=But let your villager friends know—if anyone tries to attack me, I'll wipe this place clean off the map.
M5220_S0030_G0110_001_pascal=I will make a firm note of it.
M5220_S0030_G0120_001_pascal=Er, A2?
M5220_S0030_G0130_001_pascal=If you like, you're welcome to take a look around our village.
M5220_S0030_G0140_001_pascal=It would be nice for you to know more about us.
M5220_S0030_G0150_001_a2=Sure. If I feel like it.
