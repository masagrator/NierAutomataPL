M5222_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Hello, A2.
M5222_S0010_G0010_001_pascal=I appreciate all the time and effort you took for our children.
M5222_S0010_G0020_001_pascal=Every one of them is a singular treasure to me.
M5222_S0010_G0030_001_pascal=Indeed, they are treasures to the entire village\! Our very future rests in their little hands.
M5222_S0010_G0040_001_pascal=I imagine you find it odd for machines to speak of the future like this.
M5222_S0010_G0050_001_a2=I dunno.
M5222_S0010_G0060_001_pascal=I trust that our children can stand strong against the senseless conflicts of this world and blaze a new trail for our people.
M5222_S0010_G0070_001_pascal=However...
M5222_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=One of the children is suffering from a faulty storage element.
M5222_S0010_G0090_001_pascal=If we don't do something for the childâ€”
M5222_S0010_G0100_001_a2=So repair it already.
M5222_S0010_G0110_001_pascal=Alas, we lack the parts to do so.
M5222_S0010_G0120_001_pascal=They can only be found deep within the abandoned factory, and that area is swarming with terrible machines...
M5222_S0010_G0130_001_pascal=It pains me to say this, but you, A2, are the only one we can turn to.
M5222_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Help Pascal.
M5222_S0010_G0150_001_sele=Refuse.
M5222_S0010_G0160_001_pascal=I understand. Though I hope you will reconsider at a later time.
M5222_S0010_G0170_001_pascal=We need a certain part to repair one of the children.
M5222_S0010_G0180_001_pascal=Would you perhaps lend us your aid?
M5222_S0010_G0190_001_pascal=Thank you so much.
M5222_S0010_G0200_001_pascal=The required part is in the area known as the abandoned factory. I truly do appreciate this.
M5222_S0010_G0210_001_pascal=The part needed to repair the child is in the area known as the abandoned factory.
M5222_S0010_G0220_001_pascal=I appreciate your help.
M5222_S0020_G0000_001_pod042=Enemy machines destroyed.
M5222_S0020_G0010_001_a2=So this is the part Pascal wanted?
M5222_S0020_G0020_001_a2=Can't believe I'm killing machines to save a machine.
M5222_S0020_G0030_001_a2=......
M5222_S0020_G0040_001_a2=Ah, screw it. Better go see Pascal.
M5222_S0030_G0000_001_pascal=Ah, A2\! You have the part needed to repair the child\!
M5222_S0030_G0010_001_pascal=I cannot thank you enough.
M5222_S0030_G0020_001_pascal=This is meager compared to what you've done, but please take it.
M5222_S0030_G0030_001_pascal=In all honestly, we could have transferred the child's core to another body instead of repairing the original.
M5222_S0030_G0040_001_pascal=This process allows us to resurrect ourselves as many times as we want.
M5222_S0030_G0050_001_pascal=However, it comes at the cost of our memories.
M5222_S0030_G0060_001_pascal=So in a way, he would no longer be the same child.
M5222_S0030_G0070_001_pascal=Thankfully, this is no longer an issue. Thank you so much\!
