M5440_S0000_G0010_300_a2b=Hmm... Don't need this.
M5440_S0000_G0020_300_a2=This looks useless.
M5440_S0000_G0030_300_a9s=Doesn't look like I'll need this.
M5440_S0010_G0000_001_n02=Hey friend didja hear all them rumors 'bout that place with the trees and the bushes and the leaves and the castle built by the first machine king and the big ol' treasure
M5440_S0010_G0010_001_n02=what's in there behind locked doors or gates or moats or whatnot and ya wonder what it could be and boy howdy I'd love to find out and see it for m'self don't ya know?
M5440_S0010_G0020_001_a2b=...Huh.
M5440_S0010_G0030_001_pod042=Analysis\: This machine lifeform believes there is treasure located in the forest kingdom.
M5440_S0010_G0040_001_pod042=Proposal\: 2B should investigate.
M5440_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=Um, what?
M5440_S0010_G0060_001_pod153=Analysis\: This machine lifeform believes there is treasure located in the forest kingdom.
M5440_S0010_G0070_001_pod153=Proposal\: 9S should investigate.
M5440_S0010_G0080_001_a2=The hell was that all about?
M5440_S0010_G0090_001_pod042=Analysis\: This machine lifeform believes there is treasure located in the forest kingdom.
M5440_S0010_G0100_001_pod042=Proposal\: A2 should investigate.
M5440_S0020_G0000_001_pod042=Analysis\: This part belongs to a machine lifeform.
M5440_S0020_G0010_001_a2b=So it's junk, basically.
M5440_S0020_G0020_001_a2=Great. Useless crap.
M5440_S0020_G0030_001_pod042=While lacking in value, it may be connected to the supposed treasure of the forest kingdom.
M5440_S0020_G0040_001_pod042=Proposal\: It should be confiscated for safekeeping.
M5440_S0020_G0050_001_pod153=Analysis\: This part belongs to a machine lifeform.
M5440_S0020_G0060_001_a2b=So it's just a bunch of junk?
M5440_S0020_G0070_001_pod153=While lacking in value, it may be connected to the supposed treasure of the forest kingdom.
M5440_S0020_G0080_001_pod153=Proposal\: It should be confiscated for safekeeping.

M5440_S0030_G0180_001_a2b=A library? Must be that long, narrow room.
