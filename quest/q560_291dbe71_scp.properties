M5560_S0010_G0000_001_dbl=Say, think you'd be able to give us a hand with a certain odd job?
M5560_S0010_G0010_001_ppl=Devola, please.
M5560_S0010_G0020_001_dbl=Well, what else can we do? Ever since that huge-ass Tower showed up, we've been short on people and supplies.
M5560_S0010_G0030_001_dbl=If we keep getting distracted by the little things, we'll never get those Resistance members repaired.
M5560_S0010_G0040_001_ppl=That's true, butâ€”
M5560_S0010_G0050_001_dbl=So there you have it\! Anyway, mind lending us a hand?
M5560_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Help the twins.
M5560_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Decline.
M5560_S0010_G0080_001_dbl=Pfft. I shoulda known.
M5560_S0010_G0090_001_ppl=DEVOLA\! ...Look, I'm sorry we're making all of these requests. I know your time is valuable. Please let us know if you're interested later.
M5560_S0010_G0100_001_dbl=Soooo, any chance you might help us out?
M5560_S0010_G0110_001_dbl=Great\! Much appreciated. Okay, so all we need are some stripped screws, small gears, and machine oil.
M5560_S0010_G0111_001_dbl=You can get stripped screws from the machines that look like they've been stacked on top of each other.
M5560_S0010_G0112_001_dbl=I think you can get small gears from the small machines with the short legs.
M5560_S0010_G0113_001_ppl=You should be able to find some machine oil near a deserted truck at the abandoned factory.
M5560_S0010_G0120_001_ppl=Please don't put yourself in danger for this, all right?
M5560_S0010_G0130_001_dbl=Have you tracked down those materials I was asking about?
M5560_S0010_G0140_001_ppl=We need some stripped screws, small gears, and machine oil.
M5560_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=Okay, that's everything the twins asked for.
M5560_S0010_G0160_001_a2=That's everything those redhead twins wanted.\nGuess I'll hand it over.
M5560_S0030_G0000_001_dbl=Let's see... Yep\! That's everything. Thanks for the help.
M5560_S0030_G0010_001_ppl=Then it's time for us to get to work, Devola.
M5560_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Er, what are you using that stuff for, anyway?
M5560_S0030_G0030_001_a2=So what are you guys making?
M5560_S0030_G0040_001_dbl=Isn't it obvious? Daily necessities.
M5560_S0030_G0050_001_ppl=We're often asked to handle various odd jobs around the camp.
M5560_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=Odd jobs? With all of your technical skill?
M5560_S0030_G0070_001_a2=Why are they wasting the two of you on odd jobs?
M5560_S0030_G0080_001_ppl=Oh, it's no bother\! We're happy to help however we can.
M5560_S0030_G0090_001_dbl=Frankly, we're thankful to just have a job of any kind.
M5560_S0030_G0100_001_dbl=Anyway, enough gabbing. Here's your reward.
M5560_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=Oh, I couldn't possibly take this much.
M5560_S0030_G0120_001_a2=Uh, guys? This is a LOT.
M5560_S0030_G0130_001_dbl=Just take it already\! It's not like we have anything to spend it on.
M5560_S0030_G0140_001_ppl=Go on. You earned it.
M5560_S0030_G0150_001_dbl=Maybe you'll agree to help us again later?
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Are you looking for something?
