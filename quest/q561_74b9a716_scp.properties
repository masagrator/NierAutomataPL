M5561_S0010_G0000_001_ppl=Hello again.
M5561_S0010_G0010_001_ppl=I'd love to sit here and chat, but we need to head out and take care of a job.
M5561_S0010_G0020_001_ppl=Things are a little crazy around here at the moment. I need to get these materials post-haste and...
M5561_S0010_G0030_001_dbl=Hey, Sis? Just ask already.
M5561_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=You want me to get the materials for you?
M5561_S0010_G0050_001_a2=Let me guess\: You need a scrap collector.
M5561_S0010_G0060_001_ppl=Oh, we couldn't possibly ask\!
M5561_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Agree to secure the materials.
M5561_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Ignore the hint.
M5561_S0010_G0090_001_dbl=Look, I'll be honest—I'm worried about sending Popola out to find this stuff.
M5561_S0010_G0100_001_dbl=I was really hoping you might pitch in.
M5561_S0010_G0110_001_dbl=Please? Pretty please? With cream on top?
M5561_S0010_G0120_001_dbl=Thanks. This is a HUGE help.
M5561_S0010_G0130_001_ppl=Devola, we can't keep asking people to—
M5561_S0010_G0140_001_dbl=Yes we CAN, Sis\! Let's just be grateful for the help.
M5561_S0010_G0150_001_dbl=Anyway, I just need you to track down some desert roses.
M5561_S0010_G0160_001_dbl=It's a pretty rare plant, but I'd start by searching around the old ruins in the desert.
M5561_S0010_G0170_001_ppl=Sorry to put you through this. And please be careful\! Some of the desert enemies are quite strong.
M5561_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Those desert roses the twins wanted should be around here somewhere.
M5561_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Finding one in a place like this won't be easy.
M5561_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Why are those two engaged in such dangerous work anyway?
M5561_S0020_G0030_001_a2=Those desert roses the twins wanted should be around here somewhere, but finding them is gonna be a serious pain.
M5561_S0020_G0040_001_a2=Why are they running such dangerous missions in the first place?
M5561_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=That's the last desert rose. Better get these back to Devola and Popola.
M5561_S0020_G0060_001_a2=That's it for the desert roses. Time to head back.
M5561_S0030_G0000_001_dbl=Hey, thanks\! This'll be more than enough desert roses.
M5561_S0030_G0010_001_ppl=I know this wasn't easy. Thank you.
M5561_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Those two sure draw some difficult assignments, huh?
M5561_S0030_G0030_001_pod153=Hypothesis\: Continued difficult assignments will eventually have a deleterious effect on the entire organization.
M5561_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=Hmm. Maybe I should talk this over with Anemone.
M5561_S0030_G0050_001_a2=I don't get it. Why are the twins being stuck with all these crap jobs?
M5561_S0030_G0060_001_pod042=Hypothesis\: Continued "crap jobs" will eventually have a deleterious effect on the entire organization.
M5561_S0030_G0070_001_a2=I'd better talk to the lady in charge about this.
M5561_S0030_G0080_001_ane=Yes? What is it? ...And why are you scowling at me like that?
M5561_S0030_G0090_001_ane=Ah. I see. This is about Devola and Popola.
M5561_S0030_G0100_001_ane=I understand how unfair it must seem for them to keep getting our most difficult and dangerous assignments.
M5561_S0030_G0110_001_ane=But I'm afraid that's going to continue for a while.
M5561_S0030_G0120_001_ane=The others here... Well, they still haven't forgiven them.
M5561_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=I don't understand. Forgiven them for what?
M5561_S0030_G0140_001_a2=Forgiven them for what? And just who the hell are they, anyway?
M5561_S0030_G0150_001_ane=That...
M5561_S0030_G0160_001_ane=That's something you should ask them directly.
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Are you looking for something?
