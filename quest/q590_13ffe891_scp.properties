M5590_S0010_G0000_001_resistance=Whoa whoa whoa\! Watch your step around here\!
M5590_S0010_G0010_001_resistance=There might be ancient relics buried just beneath the surface.
M5590_S0010_G0020_001_resistance=...Hmm? Me? I'm researching the old world.
M5590_S0010_G0030_001_resistance=You guys are with YoRHa, right?
M5590_S0010_G0040_001_resistance=Say, if you find anything in the desert that looks like a relic, can you bring it to me? I'll find a way to reward you for the trouble.
M5590_S0010_G0050_001_resistance=Say, if you find anything in the desert that looks like an old-world relic, can you bring it to me? I'll find a way to reward you for the trouble.
M5590_S0010_G0060_001_a2b=Relics from the old world, eh?
M5590_S0010_G0070_001_pod042=Searching for relics in the desert without assistance might prove difficult.
M5590_S0010_G0080_001_pod042=Proposal\: Unit 2B should use the dynamic scanner.
M5590_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=Relics from the old world...
M5590_S0010_G0100_001_pod153=Searching for relics in the desert without assistance might prove difficult.
M5590_S0010_G0110_001_pod153=Proposal\: Unit 9S should use the dynamic scanner.
M5590_S0010_G0120_001_a2=So I need to find junk from the old world now?
M5590_S0010_G0130_001_pod042=Searching for relics in the desert without assistance might prove difficult.
M5590_S0010_G0140_001_pod042=Proposal\: Unit A2 should use the dynamic scanner.
M5590_S0010_G0150_001_resistance=Hey, I haven't seen you before.
M5590_S0010_G0160_001_resistance=I'm here conducting research on the old world.
M5590_S0010_G0170_001_resistance=If you find anything in the desert that looks like a relic, can you bring it to me? I'll find a way to reward you for the trouble.
M5590_S0020_G0000_001_pod042=Old world material obtained.
M5590_S0020_G0010_001_pod042=Hypothesis\: Said material is likely a relic from an ancient civilization.
M5590_S0020_G0020_001_pod153=Old world material obtained.
M5590_S0020_G0030_001_pod153=Hypothesis\: Said material is likely a relic from an ancient civilization.
M5590_S0020_G0040_001_resistance=Did you find something for me?
M5590_S0020_G0050_001_resistance=Hmm... Looks like some kind of staff.
M5590_S0020_G0060_001_resistance=That's pretty incredible. Let me pay you for your help.
M5590_S0020_G0070_001_resistance=This was likely a tool used for some kind of ceremony. I imagine it belonged to the nation that used to exist in this region.
M5590_S0020_G0080_001_resistance=If you find any more relics, make sure to bring them to me.
M5590_S0030_G0000_001_resistance=Ah\! A stone tablet with laws written upon it\! That's definitely worth a reward.
M5590_S0030_G0010_001_resistance=This isn't the only tablet of its kind that we've found, either.
M5590_S0030_G0020_001_resistance=I think the nation that once existed here lived under an almost impossible number of rules.
M5590_S0030_G0030_001_resistance=The more they expanded their civilization, the more rules they had to come up with.
M5590_S0030_G0040_001_resistance=They ended up living their lives bound by rules. Seems like a waste if you ask me...
M5590_S0030_G0050_001_resistance=If you find any more relics, make sure to bring 'em to me\!
M5590_S0040_G0000_001_resistance=Oh, this is just lovely. Let me pay you for it\!
M5590_S0040_G0010_001_resistance=Huh, so it's some kind of mask. Judging by the design, it was intended to be worn by a female.
M5590_S0040_G0020_001_resistance=According to legend, the nation that used to be here was wiped out quite suddenly.
M5590_S0040_G0030_001_resistance=Apparently it had something to do with the passing of a beloved king.
M5590_S0040_G0040_001_resistance=Perhaps this mask belonged to a princess or the like.
M5590_S0040_G0050_001_resistance=If you find any more relics, make sure to bring 'em to me\!
M5590_S0050_G0000_001_robolarge=Hold\! You cannot pass\! It is unforgivable\!
M5590_S0050_G0010_001_robosmall=UNFORGIVABLE\!\!
M5590_S0050_G0020_001_robolarge=Give us your money and your life\!
M5590_S0050_G0030_001_robosmall=AND YOUR LIFE\!
M5590_S0050_G0040_001_a2b=Enemies?
M5590_S0050_G0050_001_a9s=Uh oh.
M5590_S0050_G0060_001_a2=Well, crap.
M5590_S0050_G0070_001_a2b=These enemies...
M5590_S0050_G0080_001_pod042=Hostile machine lifeforms defeated.
M5590_S0050_G0090_001_pod042=Analysis\: Their garments were based on a subset of human culture.
M5590_S0050_G0100_001_a2b=Explain.
M5590_S0050_G0110_001_pod042=Examples of said clothing can be found in "motion pictures" that humans created for entertainment purposes.
M5590_S0050_G0120_001_pod042=More specifically, they were from a genre known as "Westerns" that chronicled warfare in a certain region of the planet.
M5590_S0050_G0130_001_a2b=Warfare was...entertainment?
M5590_S0050_G0140_001_a9s=What the heck were those guys?
M5590_S0050_G0150_001_pod153=The hostile machine lifeforms have been defeated.
M5590_S0050_G0160_001_pod153=Analysis\: Their garments were based on a subset of human culture.
M5590_S0050_G0170_001_a9s=Human culture?
M5590_S0050_G0180_001_pod153=Examples of said clothing can be found in "motion pictures" that humans created for entertainment purposes.
M5590_S0050_G0190_001_pod153=More specifically, they were from a genre known as "Westerns" that chronicled warfare in a certain region of the planet.
M5590_S0050_G0200_001_a9s=Warfare as entertainment? What were humans thinking?
M5590_S0050_G0210_001_a2=What the hell were those guys?
M5590_S0050_G0220_001_pod042=Hostile machine lifeforms defeated.
M5590_S0050_G0230_001_pod042=Analysis\: Their garments were based on a subset of human culture.
M5590_S0050_G0240_001_a2=Er, run that by me again?
M5590_S0050_G0250_001_pod042=Examples of said clothing can be found in "motion pictures" that humans created for entertainment purposes.
M5590_S0050_G0260_001_pod042=More specifically, they were from a genre known as "Westerns" that chronicled warfare in a certain region of the planet.
M5590_S0050_G0270_001_a2=Warfare as entertainment? Humans really were crazy.
M5590_S0050_G0280_001_resistance=This is...a statue of a young woman.
M5590_S0050_G0290_001_resistance=Hmm... The words "On Your Wedding Day" are carved into it.
M5590_S0050_G0300_001_resistance=Perhaps this is a representation of the bride.
M5590_S0050_G0310_001_resistance=This reminds me of something I've recently discovered in the course of my work.
M5590_S0050_G0320_001_resistance=It appears that this area used to be known as "Facade."
M5590_S0050_G0330_001_resistance=As the name suggests, the residents of Facade all wore masks, as well as unusual clothes.
M5590_S0050_G0340_001_resistance=They also spoke a language unique to their people.
M5590_S0050_G0350_001_resistance=Anyway, listen to me ramble. Thanks again for your help. Please take this, okay?
M5590_S0050_G0360_001_resistance=I wonder what kind of civilization used to exist here...
