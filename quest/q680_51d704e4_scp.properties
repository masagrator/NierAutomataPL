M5680_S0010_G0000_001_n02=Hello\! You're an android, are you not?
M5680_S0010_G0010_001_n02=Let me ask you something\: Do you think the world is full of love?
M5680_S0010_G0020_001_sele=Er, it might be?
M5680_S0010_G0030_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0040_001_n02=Don't you think we all need to express more happiness in our daily lives?
M5680_S0010_G0050_001_sele=I suppose?
M5680_S0010_G0060_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0070_001_n02=Exactly\! In which case...
M5680_S0010_G0080_001_n02=You seem like just the person to help me make this world a better place\!
M5680_S0010_G0090_001_sele=Sure, I guess.
M5680_S0010_G0100_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0110_001_n02=...Really?
M5680_S0010_G0120_001_n02=Do you believe in the dream of connecting the entire world with love?
M5680_S0010_G0130_001_sele=I do.
M5680_S0010_G0140_001_sele=No.
M5680_S0010_G0150_001_n02=Ah. I see.
M5680_S0010_G0170_001_n02=I see, I see. Then perhaps I can believe in you.
M5680_S0010_G0180_001_n02=You see, there are many machines who detest fighting.
M5680_S0010_G0190_001_n02=As such, I have decided to gather them together in order to hold a parade.
M5680_S0010_G0200_001_n02=It will be a parade of love and friendship for all\!
M5680_S0010_G0210_001_n02=However, as it turns out, there are many among us who frown upon such outspoken expressions of peace.
M5680_S0010_G0220_001_n02=Therefore, I'm hoping you will protect our parade in order to ensure the successful dispensation of its wonderful message.
M5680_S0010_G0230_001_sele=Agree to guard the parade.
M5680_S0010_G0240_001_sele=Turn down the request.
M5680_S0010_G0250_001_n02=A pity. Well, if you change your mind, do let me know.
M5680_S0010_G0260_001_n02=I wish to hold a parade to march to the Resistance camp as a symbol of our friendship. Would you be willing to help?
M5680_S0010_G0270_001_n02=Thank you for your support\!
M5680_S0010_G0280_001_n02=If you could keep my companions safe while we conduct the parade, I would be ever so happy\!
M5680_S0010_G0290_001_n02=Now then... Let us show everyone the power of friendship\!
M5680_S0020_G0000_001_robos=Share in the happiness\!
M5680_S0020_G0010_001_robos=No more fighting\!
M5680_S0020_G0020_001_robos=Spread love throughout the world\!
M5680_S0020_G0030_001_robos=Live to have fun\!
M5680_S0020_G0040_001_robos=Abandon all hatred\!
M5680_S0020_G0050_001_n02=Ahhh\! Help me\! Please help me\!
M5680_S0020_G0060_001_n02=We did not come here to fight\!
M5680_S0020_G0070_001_n02=Please help\!
M5680_S0020_G0080_001_n02=All we need is love\!
M5680_S0020_G0090_001_n02=Noooooo\!
M5680_S0020_G0100_001_n02=Haaaaaalp\!
M5680_S0020_G0110_001_n02=I don't want to fight\!
M5680_S0020_G0120_001_n02=Happiness to all\!
M5680_S0020_G0130_001_n02=Thank you very much.
M5680_S0020_G0140_001_n02=We managed to complete the parade without being annihilated.
M5680_S0020_G0150_001_n02=I know this isn't much of a reward, but please accept it.
M5680_S0020_G0160_001_n02=Ooooh... Why did such violence have to occur?
M5680_S0020_G0170_001_n02=Still, I refuse to give up. I will try again\!
M5680_S0020_G0180_001_n02=This time, I swear to hold a parade that brings peace to the world\!
M5680_S0020_G0190_001_sele=Help the parade.
M5680_S0020_G0200_001_sele=Refuse.
M5680_S0040_G0030_001_n02=Don't be that way. Come, let's get going\!
M5680_S0040_G0060_001_n02=How wonderful\! I think our joy really came across this time.
M5680_S0040_G0070_001_n02=We'll soon be holding another parade elsewhere. I hope we can count on your support for that as well.
M5680_S0040_G0080_001_n02=So do you...
M5680_S0040_G0090_001_n02=Do you think us fools?
M5680_S0040_G0100_001_n02=......
M5680_S0040_G0110_001_n02=I'm sorry. I hope to see you again.
M5680_S0050_G0000_001_n02=Ah. It's you.
M5680_S0050_G0010_001_n02=I'm afraid I was simply no longer able to deal with it.
M5680_S0050_G0020_001_n02=Joy? Love? What is the point? Happiness wasn't going to keep me from getting killed, now was it?
M5680_S0050_G0030_001_n02=...Hmm? You wish to know where the rest of the paraders went?
M5680_S0050_G0040_001_n02=They took off on some kind of journey. "To bring joy to the ends of the earth\!" was their cry, if I remember correctly.
M5680_S0050_G0050_001_n02=I lost contact with them once they reached the deep desert.
M5680_S0050_G0060_001_n02=I imagine they're now dead by the side of some road.
M5680_S0050_G0070_001_n02=No doubt they were rambling on about love and happiness to the bitter end. What madness...
