M5910_S0010_G0000_001_kj=Hmm? Haven't seen you before.
M5910_S0010_G0010_001_toolshop=Who are you?
M5910_S0010_G0020_001_adjuster=......
M5910_S0010_G0040_001_resiwomanB=Have I seen you somewhere before?
M5910_S0010_G0050_001_resimanA=Hey, you gonna be all right with those wounds?
M5910_S0100_G0000_001_pascal=Help\! Help me\!
M5910_S0100_G0010_001_a2=Are those machines fighting each other?
M5910_S0100_G0020_001_pascal=Thank you so much for saving me.
M5910_S0100_G0030_001_a2=You're a machine too...
M5910_S0100_G0040_001_pascal=Wait, please\! I have no intention of harming you\!
M5910_S0100_G0050_001_pascal=My name is Pascal. And while it's true that I am a machine lifeform, I also detest fighting of any kind.
M5910_S0100_G0060_001_a2=Uh huh. And?
M5910_S0100_G0070_001_a2=Machines don't have souls. They're just murder bots with a fancy name.
M5910_S0100_G0080_001_a2=They killed so many of us...and I swore to make them pay.
M5910_S0100_G0090_001_pascal=Ah...I see.
M5910_S0100_G0100_001_pascal=If that will save your soul, then so be it.
M5910_S0100_G0110_001_sele=Destroy Pascal.
M5910_S0100_G0120_001_sele=Let Pascal live.
M5910_S0100_G0130_001_pascal=You...aren't going to kill me?
M5910_S0100_G0140_001_a2=Just shut up and leave before I change my mind.
M5910_S0100_G0150_001_pascal=You...
M5910_S0100_G0155_001_pascal=...
M5910_S0100_G0160_001_pascal=No. Never mind.
M5910_S0100_G0170_001_pascal=You have my thanks.
M5910_S0200_G0090_001_ane=Number Two\! You're still alive.
M5910_S0200_G0100_001_a2=Sorry I haven't been in touch, Anemone.
M5910_S0200_G0110_001_ane=You survived. That's all that matters.
M5910_S0200_G0120_001_ane=Though I fear that all of your fighting companions are long gone.
M5910_S0200_G0130_001_ane=I had to kill Number 21 with my own hands.
M5910_S0200_G0140_001_a2=......
M5910_S0200_G0150_001_a2=I'm sorry.
M5910_S0200_G0160_001_ane=No, it's...
M5910_S0200_G0170_001_ane=Oh, that's right\! Did you know there was a YoRHa member here named 2B that looked just like you? She's—
M5910_S0200_G0180_001_a2=She's dead.
M5910_S0200_G0190_001_ane=What?
M5910_S0200_G0200_001_a2=2B is dead. I killed her. She was infected with a logic virus.
M5910_S0200_G0210_001_ane=Oh...
M5910_S0200_G0220_001_ane=Well, please make yourself at home in our camp. I'll have someone show you aro—
M5910_S0200_G0230_001_a2=Not necessary.
M5910_S0200_G0240_001_a2=Her memories are contained in this sword.
M5910_S0200_G0250_001_ane=I see.
M5910_S0200_G0260_001_ane=You can go ahead and use her old room, then.
M5910_S0200_G0270_001_ane=I'm in charge of the camp here. I'll make sure to tell everyone about you.
