M1080_S0020_G0000_201_pod153=Proposal\: Engage memory core diagnostics.
M1080_S0020_G0010_201_a9s=Yeah, yeah.
M1080_S0020_G0020_201_pod153=A single reply is sufficient for acknowledgment.
M1080_S0020_G0030_201_a9s=Fiiine.
M1080_S0020_G0040_201_pod153=Memory core diagnostics complete. No issues detected.
M1080_S0020_G0050_201_a9s=Good.
M1080_S0020_G0060_201_pod153=Proposal\: Engage visual sensor diagnostics.
M1080_S0020_G0070_201_a9s=You got it.
M1080_S0020_G0080_201_pod153=Visual sensor diagnostics complete. No issues detected.
M1080_S0020_G0090_201_pod153=All checks complete.
M1080_S0020_G0100_201_a9s=Whew... Took long enough.
M1080_S0020_G0110_201_a9s=Don't you think it's overkill to perform a full data overhaul?
M1080_S0020_G0120_201_pod153=Unit 9S was seized by the enemy and placed in a non-controlled state for an extended period of time.
M1080_S0020_G0130_201_pod153=There is a high probability of corruption by an enemy logic virus.
M1080_S0020_G0140_201_a9s=All right, all right. Cram it.
M1080_S0020_G0150_201_a9s=Anyway, I just gotta synch up with the Bunker server and then I'm outta here, right?
M1080_S0020_G0160_201_a9s=Huh? What was that?
M1080_S0020_G0170_201_pod153=Unknown.
M1080_S0020_G0180_201_a9s=Halt the data sync.
M1080_S0020_G0190_201_pod153=Alert\: Data synchronization is mandatory for all YoRHa units.
M1080_S0020_G0200_201_a9s=Yeah, I know that. But we just got some kind of weird noise.
M1080_S0020_G0210_201_a9s=Halt the data sync for 2B as well.
M1080_S0020_G0220_201_pod153=Affirmative.
M1080_S0020_G0230_201_a9s=Let's figure out where that noise came from. Just to be sure, you know?
M1080_S0020_G0240_201_a9s=Open a port to the server.
M1080_S0020_G0250_201_a9s=Hmm... No time to examine everything. Better stick to the main data nodes.
M1080_S0020_G0260_201_pod153=Detected\: Access log to Council of Humanity's lunar server.
M1080_S0020_G0270_201_a9s=What's a barrier doing here...?
M1080_S0020_G0280_201_a9s=Hmm... Looks like records for supplies shipped to the moon.
M1080_S0020_G0290_201_a9s=Strange... There were a ton of empty containers.
M1080_S0020_G0300_201_a9s=That's weird. Why would they do that?
M1080_S0020_G0310_201_pod153=Detected\: YoRHa unit storage records.
M1080_S0020_G0320_201_a9s=What's the point of all this heavy security?
M1080_S0020_G0330_201_a9s=All the black box data has been deleted, but it looks like everything else is here.
M1080_S0020_G0340_201_a9s=...Huh? A new port just opened.
M1080_S0020_G0350_201_pod153=Detected\: Council of Humanity and Project YoRHa records index.
M1080_S0020_G0360_201_pod153=Alert\: We are not authorized to access this data.
M1080_S0020_G0370_201_a9s=Man, this stuff is all wrong...
M1080_S0020_G0380_201_a9s=I need to check this out too.
M1080_S0020_G0390_201_a9s=An attack barrier? Really\!?
M1080_S0020_G0400_201_a9s=Why the heck would they install one of those in this server...?
M1080_S0020_G0410_201_a9s=Let's see... Looks like info about how the Council of Humanity was formed as part of Project YoRHa.
M1080_S0020_G0420_201_a9s=Wait. Isn't that backwards?
M1080_S0020_G0430_201_a9s=After a long period of battles and adventures, the prophet spoke.
M1080_S0020_G0440_201_a9s=O grant me the mercy of the land\!
M1080_S0020_G0450_201_a9s=O grant me the joy of the heavens\!
M1080_S0020_G0460_201_a9s=Release me from my yoke of iron\!
M1080_S0020_G0470_201_a9s=Thus shall our souls beâ€”
M1080_S0020_G0480_201_a9s=......
M1080_S0020_G0490_201_a9s=What was that?
M1080_S0020_G0500_201_a9s=Crap\! Did they find me?
M1080_S0020_G0510_201_pod153=Negative. Emergency backup request from 2B.
M1080_S0020_G0520_201_a9s=Close the server connection and activate my body.
M1080_S0020_G0530_201_a9s=Affirmative.
