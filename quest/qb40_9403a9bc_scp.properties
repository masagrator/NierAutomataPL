M6010_S0010_G0640_300_ys=Everything's proceeding smoothly. \nThere's no sign anyone's noticed any—
M6010_S0010_G0650_300_ys=What's your problem? Get outta my face before I rearrange yours\!
M6010_S0010_G0660_300_ys=Back off\! This is none of your business\!
M6010_S0010_G0670_300_ys=...Yeah, just a minor annoyance. Nothing to get your undies in a twist over.
M6010_S0010_G0680_300_ys=Hey, didn't you hear me the first time? Make like a machine and get outta here\!
M6010_S0010_G0690_300_ys=Man, these operators are so fussy\! Wish they'd just get me the data I need and let me do my thing\!
M6010_S0010_G0700_300_ys=My partner seems...tense. Do you think it's something I did?
M6010_S0010_G0710_300_ys=The operators try hard to explain everything, but I'm still so confused. ...I just hope I don't get in anyone's way.
M6010_S0010_G0720_300_ys=Yeah, sorry, but I don't really get it. Can you explain it again? Maybe go a little slower this time?
M6010_S0010_G0730_300_op=That concludes your mission summary. As for the detailed breakdown, the first thing to remember is...
M6010_S0010_G0740_300_op=Um, unless something is literally on fire, please go away. I'm in the middle of a critical mission briefing.
M6010_S0010_G0750_300_op=This unit was only manufactured recently, so she's still quite nervous.
M6010_S0010_G0760_300_op=You aren't a full-fledged operator until you can summarize information accurately and concisely.
M6010_S0010_G0770_300_op=She can relax a little, though. I'll cover for her. She's my partner, after all. You guys know what that's like.
M6010_S0010_G0780_300_ys=Don't worry, I can take care of myself. I've got plenty of recovery items.
M6010_S0010_G0790_300_ys=Uuuurgh...
M6010_S0010_G0800_300_ys=Look, I'm grateful that people are concerned about me, but at some point they need to just let me go on a mission\!
M6010_S0010_G0810_300_op=Are you feeling all right?
M6010_S0010_G0820_300_op=Do you have enough recovery items? How are your vital signs? It's critical to deal with injuries right away\!
M6010_S0010_G0830_300_op=I'm so worried... Maybe I should talk to one of the operators and request a model change.
M6010_S0010_G0940_300_ys=Listen up\! The future of the human race is in our hands\! Now get out there and complete your missions\!
M6010_S0010_G0950_300_ys=If you come across any machines, show no mercy and grant no quarter\! Their evil must not be forgiven\!
M6010_S0010_G0960_300_ys=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0010_G0970_300_ys=Just like our commanding officer, my dream is to kill scores of machines and contribute to humanity's great victory.
M6010_S0010_G0980_300_ys=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0010_G0990_300_ys=Fighting isn't really my thing, but they assigned me to combat duty anyway. Wonder if I can transfer to being an operator...
M6010_S0010_G1000_300_ys=Glory to mankind...
M6010_S0010_G1010_300_ys=Our commanding officer loooves formalities. Me? I'd rather just get the orders over with and start the mission already.
M6010_S0010_G1020_300_ys=Glory to mankind.
M6010_S0010_G1030_300_op=They're so obsessed with giving orders, they forget to provide details about the actual mission\! I sure hope we're going to be okay...
M6010_S0010_G1040_300_op=Still, I'll be managing things once everyone's on Earth, so at least I know THAT part will go smoothly.
M6010_S0010_G1050_300_op=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0020_G0640_300_ys=Do you believe... I mean, do you even know who this war is FOR at this point?
M6010_S0020_G0650_300_ys=Er, never mind. I've said too much.
M6010_S0020_G0660_300_ys=...You don't have to watch me like that, you know? I'm not planning a rebellion or anything.
M6010_S0020_G0670_300_ys=Feel free to report me to Command if you feel like it.
M6010_S0020_G0680_300_ys=They wouldn't listen even if you did.
M6010_S0020_G0690_300_ys=Hey, how's it going? ...Hmm? Us? Uh, we're fine, I guess.
M6010_S0020_G0700_300_ys=Better than we were at the beginning, although we still have a ways to go. Lots of hard work ahead for sure.
M6010_S0020_G0710_300_ys=Missions seem easier now—or maybe I'm just more used to them. I mean, I still get in the way sometimes, but I'm learning.
M6010_S0020_G0720_300_ys=Mission received loud and clear\! I won't let you down\!
M6010_S0020_G0730_300_op=...And that concludes the mission briefing. I'll contact you later with further details.
M6010_S0020_G0740_300_op=...What? Why are you looking at me like that?
M6010_S0020_G0750_300_op=Lately, she's been doing all her work perfectly. I'm actually starting to miss when she needed help.
M6010_S0020_G0760_300_op=You guys always seem to be synched up. We're gonna make sure we are, too\!
M6010_S0020_G0770_300_ys=When you're fighting alongside your comrades, you can't just run away when things get hairy.
M6010_S0020_G0780_300_ys=That's why I make sure to back up my data regularly and repair any injuries right away. ...So someone tell those operators to just relax already\!
M6010_S0020_G0790_300_ys=Combat troops exist to fight.
M6010_S0020_G0800_300_ys=My comrades and I want only to contribute to humanity's great victory. Can I assume you feel the same?
M6010_S0020_G0810_300_op=Don't ever let your guard down, you hear me?
M6010_S0020_G0820_300_op=If you're in danger, back off and wait for reinforcements. Also, whenever— Hey\! Are you listening to me\!?
M6010_S0020_G0830_300_op=You were damn lucky to escape unharmed the other day, you know? Next time things might not turn out so well.
M6010_S0020_G0840_300_op=Maybe I should change to a combat model so I can help you out...
M6010_S0020_G0950_300_ys=You did great in the last mission. Such efforts are how we will win this war and bring glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0020_G0960_300_ys=Justice cannot fail. We must endure on behalf of those who have fallen before us.
M6010_S0020_G0970_300_ys=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0020_G0980_300_ys=I want to contribute to the victory of mankind, but right now, I just hold everyone back. I hope I finally get a chance to make a difference someday...
M6010_S0020_G0990_300_ys=Glory to mankind\!
M6010_S0020_G1000_300_ys=I hate the thought of dying for humans when I've never even seen one.
M6010_S0020_G1010_300_ys=I just want to keep living here with my friends. Is that too much to ask?
M6010_S0020_G1020_300_ys=Glory to mankind...
M6010_S0020_G1030_300_ys=If one of us is going to get hit, the commanding officer steps in to take it in their place.
M6010_S0020_G1040_300_ys=But each time that happens, the officer's data resets—which means she never remembers any of us or what she did. It's so stupid.
M6010_S0020_G1050_300_ys=Glory to mankind.
M6010_S0020_G1060_300_op=If we made peace with the machines, no one else would have to die. Yet that's a trade-off some of us still aren't willing to make.
M6010_S0020_G1070_300_op=Glory to mankind.
M6010_S0080_G0340_300_op="This is the Bunker. I'm uploading the data required for your next mission."
M6010_S0080_G0350_300_op=...What the hell are YOU doing here?
M6010_S0080_G0360_300_op=We're fighting a war on Earth, you know? And you need to get down there and help out NOW\!
M6010_S0080_G0370_300_op="This is the Bunker."
M6010_S0080_G0380_300_op="We're reading a sudden decrease in your vital signs. Please make sure you don't push yourself too hard."
M6010_S0080_G0390_300_op=...You know, while you sit here lazing about and eating bon-bons, someone is probably down on Earth stealing your glory\!
M6010_S0080_G0400_300_op="This is the Bunker."
M6010_S0080_G0410_300_op="Are you experiencing anything unusual?"
M6010_S0080_G0415_300_op=" Your vital signs appear normal, but there's always the possibility of undetected errors. It's about time you returned for maintenance."
M6010_S0080_G0420_300_op="No, wait\! Stay on the line\!"
M6010_S0080_G0430_300_op=...Dammit\! I can't get through\! What if something's happening?
M6010_S0080_G0440_300_op="This is the Bunker\! Come in\! ...Do you read me\!?"
M6010_S0080_G0510_300_op="This is the Bunker. I'm uploading updated mission intel to you now."
M6010_S0080_G0520_300_op="Make sure to listen to your commanding officer, and don't push yourself too hard."
M6010_S0080_G0530_300_op=Hmm? Done with your mission already? Must be nice\!
