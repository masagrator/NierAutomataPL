M5562_S0030_G0250_001_ppl=Guess what? Devola made more of her famous desert rose liquor\!
M5562_S0030_G0260_001_ppl=You're welcome to some if you like.
M5770_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=Hey, so you craft new weapons from older models, right? But where do the older models come from?
M5770_S0030_G0111_001_a2b=Hey, so where do you get these older weapon models from?
M5770_S0030_G0112_001_a2=So where do all these older weapon models come from, huh?
M5770_S0030_G0120_001_kj=Oh, the lady who owns the place sends 'em over every once in a while.
M5770_S0030_G0130_001_kj=Her name's Accord, and she's the proprietor of this here business. I just tend to customers and keep all the repair devices humming.
M5770_S0030_G0140_001_kj=I only see her every few years, to be honest. She mostly just uses delivery drones to drop things off.
M5770_S0030_G0150_001_kj=I don't know where she gets this stuff, but most of it's in pretty good condition\!
M5770_S0030_G0160_001_kj=Say, if you ever happen to run into her, say hello from me, all right?
M6010_S0010_G0000_001_ane=You've changed, Number Two. The way you talk and act is completely different from how you were in the past.
M6010_S0010_G0010_001_a2=And you've become a true leader.
M6010_S0010_G0020_001_ane=I'm nothing compared to Rose.
M6010_S0010_G0030_001_ane=......
M6010_S0010_G0040_001_ane=Actually, I... Well, I have the records stored on that external drive.
M6010_S0010_G0050_001_ane=I thought I should preserve memories of the time we fought together.
M6010_S0010_G0060_001_ane=And I also think you have a right to see them.
M6010_S0010_G0070_001_a2=......
M6010_S0010_G0080_001_ane=You and I must never forget.
M6010_S0010_G0090_001_a2=...I know.
M6090_S0010_G0000_300_ane=How's it going? You hanging in there?
M6090_S0010_G0010_300_ane=If you're bored, there are plenty of people here who could use your help.
M6090_S0010_G0020_300_kj=Hey there\! I'm here for all your weapon-related needs.
M6090_S0010_G0030_300_kj=Do you need weapons?
M6090_S0010_G0040_300_kj=Don't be a stranger\!
M6090_S0010_G0050_300_toolshop=Welcome. What are you buying?
M6090_S0010_G0060_300_toolshop=What would you like to buy?
M6090_S0010_G0070_300_toolshop=Come back soon\!
M6090_S0010_G0810_300_ys=If there's something you want to listen to, feel free to change the song.
M6090_S0010_G0820_300_ys=I like calm songs because they're soothing, but intense songs get you ready to kick some tail\!
M6090_S0010_G0830_300_bs=Hello. You're with YoRHa, aren't you?
M6090_S0010_G0840_300_bs=This is the Maintenance Shop. I service and consult on all types of android bodies.
M6090_S0010_G0850_300_bs=Can I help you with anything?
M6090_S0010_G0860_300_bs=You can greatly increase your combat abilities with just a few tweaks here and there.
M6090_S0010_G0870_300_bs=If you obtain any new chips or programs, make sure to try them out\!
M6090_S0010_G0880_300_bs=Need any maintenance?
M6090_S0010_G0890_300_bs=Come back any time\!
M6090_S0010_G0900_300_sele=Shop
M6090_S0010_G0910_300_sele=Ask for Advice
M6090_S0010_G0915_300_sele=Never Mind
M6090_S0010_G0920_300_bs=What would you like advice on?
M6090_S0010_G0930_300_sele=Android Bodies
M6090_S0010_G0940_300_sele=Upgrading Pods
M6090_S0010_G0950_300_sele=Acquiring Additional Pods
M6090_S0010_G0960_300_sele=Weapons
M6090_S0010_G0970_300_sele=Motion Sickness
M6090_S0010_G0975_300_sele=Back
M6090_S0010_G0990_300_bs=Android bodies are just that\: bodies that belong to YoRHa androids.
M6090_S0010_G1000_300_bs=There are two ways to enhance them\: experience points or plug-in chips.
M6090_S0010_G1010_300_bs=Everyone knows what experience points are, so I'm not going to waste your time with a long-winded explanation.
M6090_S0010_G1020_300_bs=Plug-in chips are items that enhance bodies. They have various functions.
M6090_S0010_G1030_300_bs=However, we recognize that the process can be a tad confusing, and we don't want you rage-quitting over it.
M6090_S0010_G1040_300_bs=So, I can actually recommend a chip setup based on what you're carrying right now. Wanna give it a try?
M6090_S0010_G1050_300_sele=Yes
M6090_S0010_G1060_300_sele=No
M6090_S0010_G1070_300_bs=What do you want to focus on?
M6090_S0010_G1080_300_sele=Balance
M6090_S0010_G1090_300_sele=Attack
M6090_S0010_G1100_300_sele=Defense
M6090_S0010_G1105_300_sele=Never Mind
M6090_S0010_G1110_300_bs=Got it. I'll get you set up right away.
M6090_S0010_G1120_300_bs=Okay, you're all set.
M6090_S0010_G1130_300_bs=There's a lot of depth to plug-in chips, so if you're interested, try experimenting with different setups to see how they work.
M6090_S0010_G1140_300_bs=Pods are tactical support units provided to YoRHa. There are two ways to upgrade them.
M6090_S0010_G1150_300_bs=The first is to take them to a maintenance shop like this one right here.
M6090_S0010_G1155_300_bs=It'll cost money and materials, but you'll end up with a stronger Pod.
M6090_S0010_G1160_300_bs=The second way is to equip them with new Pod Programs.
M6090_S0010_G1170_300_bs=There are various types of Pod Programs, and they do everything from firing attack lasers to jamming enemy movements.
M6090_S0010_G1180_300_bs=I've got a couple on sale here if you're interested.
M6090_S0010_G1190_300_bs=You can equip multiple Pods at the same time, but they're pretty rare, so we don't ever get them in stock here at the shop.
M6090_S0010_G1200_300_bs=If you manage to find another Pod or two, however, it'll make your life a lot easier\!
M6090_S0010_G1210_300_bs=I sometimes hear about Pods lying around in the desert or being dropped in the sea...
M6090_S0010_G1220_300_bs=The latest YoRHa models can equip weapons from the Weapons tab in the System Menu, which is accessed by pressing <KC_MENU>.
M6090_S0010_G1230_300_bs=You can equip two different sets with two weapons each, so try a few combinations to see what works for you.
M6090_S0010_G1240_300_bs=Oh, and you can switch weapon sets using the <KC_SHORTCUT> shortcut menu.
M6090_S0010_G1250_300_bs=Yikes\! Well, before you barf everywhere...
M6090_S0010_G1255_300_bs=Try going to System → Settings → Camera in the <KC_MENU> System Menu and changing the camera's behavior.
M6090_S0010_G1260_300_bs=Alternately, I can just adjust your camera for you. What kind of setting would you like?
M6090_S0010_G1270_300_sele=Reduce Motion Sickness
M6090_S0010_G1280_300_sele=Restore Normal Settings
M6090_S0010_G1290_300_sele=Never Mind
M6090_S0010_G1300_300_bs=Okay, I'll adjust your camera settings.
M6090_S0010_G1310_300_bs=There, all done\! You can fine-tune things yourself later if you want.
M6090_S0010_G1320_300_bs=You're the boss.
M6090_S0020_G0000_300_ane=Welcome back. If you're running low on something, you can replenish it here.
M6090_S0020_G0010_300_ane=Are you tired? Why don't you rest a little?
M6090_S0020_G0020_300_kj=It's been tough lately, but it's important to get rest. Make sure you keep your weapons in good order, too.
M6090_S0020_G0030_300_kj=Oh, do you need a weapon?
M6090_S0020_G0040_300_kj=Come again\!
M6090_S0020_G0050_300_toolshop=Welcome. We have loads of good stuff here\!
M6090_S0020_G0060_300_toolshop=Are you looking for something?
M6090_S0020_G0070_300_toolshop=Come back soon\!
M6090_S0020_G0770_300_dbl=Welcome. Is there anything you need?
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Are you looking for something?
M6090_S0020_G0790_300_dbl=Good luck.
M6090_S0020_G0800_300_ppl=Welcome. Is there anything you need?
M6090_S0020_G0810_300_ppl=What do you need?
M6090_S0020_G0820_300_ppl=I'm rooting for you.
M6090_S0020_G0830_300_ys=Are you here to listen to music?
M6090_S0020_G0840_300_ys=Long ago, the humans used to gather in places where music played. ...Just like us.
M6090_S0030_G0000_300_ane=I'm so glad you made it back safely.
M6090_S0030_G0010_300_ane=Do you need anything? It's dangerous outside, so be on your guard.
M6090_S0030_G0011_300_kj=You can upgrade the weapons you buy here.
M6090_S0030_G0012_300_kj=How much I can upgrade your weapons depends on how much money and materials you have. Some upgraded weapons also add effects that improve performance.
M6090_S0030_G0013_300_kj=Give it a try if you like.
M6090_S0030_G0020_300_kj=It sounds rough out there, so I bet you need weapons, right? Take your time and look around.
M6090_S0030_G0021_300_kj=How did you...get that weapon...?
M6090_S0030_G0022_300_kj=Oh, they died...?
M6090_S0030_G0023_300_kj=YoRHa weapons save the external memories of whoever uses them. Please take extra care of...her.
M6090_S0030_G0030_300_kj=Do you need anything?
M6090_S0030_G0041_300_kj=Right-o\! This weapon is now Level 3.
M6090_S0030_G0042_300_kj=That's as far as we can take it here, but there are craftsmen in the world who can raise it to Level 4.
M6090_S0030_G0043_300_kj=If I ever met someone like that, I'd want them to teach me all they knew\!
M6090_S0030_G0050_300_toolshop=I'll back you up no matter what\!
M6090_S0030_G0060_300_toolshop=If you need anything at all, let me know.
M6090_S0030_G0070_300_toolshop=Come back soon\!
M6090_S0030_G0300_300_dbl=Welcome back. You need anything?
M6090_S0030_G0310_300_dbl=It's been getting more dangerous recently. Make sure you're ready.
M6090_S0030_G0320_300_dbl=Take care.
M6090_S0030_G0330_300_ppl=Welcome back. You need anything?
M6090_S0030_G0340_300_ppl=It's not going to be easy, so we've got to be prepared.
M6090_S0030_G0350_300_ppl=Take care.
M6090_S0040_G0000_300_ane=Oh, it's you. Did you get the Goliath coordinate data?
M6090_S0040_G0010_300_ane=With two machines like that around, you'd better be extra careful out there.
M6090_S0040_G0020_300_ane=If you want, you can rest here. It's nothing fancy, but it's all we have.
M6090_S0050_G0000_300_ane=It seems like a lot of androids went missing in the latest mission.
M6090_S0050_G0010_300_ane=We set up a search party, but we can't get to the more dangerous areas, so the rescue mission isn't faring well.
M6090_S0050_G0020_300_ane=I know you're in a hurry, but it'd be terrible if something happened to you. Make sure you're well prepared before setting out.
M6090_S0060_G0000_300_ane=Everyone... They're all... No. Some of them must have managed to escape.
M6090_S0060_G0010_300_ane=Sorry, but this is all I can give you at the moment.
M6090_S0070_G0000_300_ane=Are you well? Any injuries?
M6090_S0070_G0010_300_ane=I'm not quite back to normal, but I'm prepared, so I can support you.
M6090_S0070_G0020_300_ane=If you need anything, make sure you pick it up before you go.
M6090_S0070_G0030_300_ane=This will settle everything. ...Glory to mankind.
M6090_S0120_G0000_300_ys=It's so relaxing to listen to music...don't you agree?
M6090_S0120_G0010_300_sele=Yep.
M6090_S0120_G0020_300_sele=Nope.
M6090_S0120_G0030_300_ys=I could tell you were a connoisseur just by looking at you\! Here, have this.
M6090_S0120_G0040_300_ys=This is what people used to call a "jukebox," a machine that plays music.
M6090_S0120_G0050_300_ys=You can play any song you like on it, as long as you have the necessary records. It's yours to use\!
M6090_S0120_G0060_300_ys=You don't? Hmm. That's too bad.
