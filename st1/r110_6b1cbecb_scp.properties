M5121_S0010_G0010_300_manager=Sorry, but can you come back later?
M5121_S0010_G0020_300_manager=I can't just sit here while everyone's fighting so hard around me. I need to shape up...
M6090_S0010_G0110_300_manager=Up ahead is the material storage site. \nSorry, but it's off-limits.
M6090_S0010_G0120_300_manager=This place is off-limits.
M6090_S0010_G0121_300_manager=What a beautiful sound...I could listen to this all day...
M6090_S0010_G0122_300_manager=You're free to come and go here whenever you please.
M6090_S0010_G0130_300_resiman=We don't know where the enemy will attack from, so we have to keep watch at all times.
M6090_S0010_G0140_300_resiman=We aren't very good at fighting. I'm jealous of you combat types.
M6090_S0010_G0150_300_resiman=Nice weather we're having, eh?
M6090_S0010_G0160_300_resiman=That guy really seems to like you. Don't worry—he's a good man at heart, though he sure likes to brag.
M6090_S0010_G0170_300_resiman=I've heard a lot about you. You're doing great work\!
M6090_S0010_G0180_300_resiman=We may not be geared for battle, but we ARE good at investigating.
M6090_S0010_G0190_300_resiman=You know about map data, right? We helped make that. In fact, I was one of— Hey\! Are you leaving already\!?
M6090_S0010_G0200_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0010_G0210_300_resiwoman=Sorry. I have to concentrate on this or I'll screw it up.
M6090_S0010_G0220_300_resiwoman=...
M6090_S0010_G0230_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0010_G0240_300_resiwoman=.........
M6090_S0010_G0250_300_resiwoman=DO YOU MIND\!?
M6090_S0010_G0260_300_resiman=All of the Resistance members in this area are based in this camp.
M6090_S0010_G0270_300_resiman=So we need to strictly manage everything and everyone that comes through here.
M6090_S0010_G0280_300_resiman=If you're ever short on anything, go talk to the guy in charge of supplies over there.
M6090_S0010_G0290_300_resiwoman=How are you? Do you like the camp? Do YoRHa soldiers ever get homesick? What do you think of the Resistance?
M6090_S0010_G0300_300_resiwoman=Our leader's nice. Really nice. Super nice\! Hey, don't look at me like that. It's because I talk so much, isn't it? It's a bad habit but
M6090_S0010_G0310_300_resiwoman=I can't help it and everyone teases me for it but my thoughts just explode and when I try to speak it just all comes out at once in a big tidal wave of words so then
M6090_S0010_G0320_300_resiwoman=I try to explain why I talk this way but I explain so quickly nobody seems to understand what I'm saying so that never gets me anywhere and
M6090_S0010_G0330_300_resiwoman=everyone just stares blankly at me and it's really annoying because when I try to slow down to their level I can't get across what I wanna say but our leader is...
M6090_S0010_G0340_300_a2b=(How can anyone possibly talk this much?)
M6090_S0010_G0360_300_a9s=(Wow. Is she EVER going to stop?)
M6090_S0010_G0370_300_resiwoman=What's wrong? Is something wrong? There is, isn't there? Don't be shy you can tell me and I'll support you as best I can even though
M6090_S0010_G0380_300_resiwoman=there's nothing much I can do because I speak so fast I don't get along with the others and so maybe that's why my memory's not so good either which is why
M6090_S0010_G0390_300_resiwoman=I'm mostly in the camp sorting supplies but recently I've been participating in the investigations around the area and just the other day I started...
M6090_S0010_G0400_300_a2b=......
M6090_S0010_G0410_300_a9s=......
M6090_S0010_G0420_300_resiwoman=Before that whole thing happened with the moon, this area actually had a proper night time.
M6090_S0010_G0430_300_resiwoman=She's a pretty odd gal, ain't she?
M6090_S0010_G0440_300_resiwoman=I don't think we've met. Er, HAVE we met? Sorry. My memory circuit is corrupted, so I forget stuff all the time.
M6090_S0010_G0450_300_resiwoman=2B and 9S from YoRHa, eh? Nope, sorry, doesn't ring a bell.
M6090_S0010_G0490_300_resiman=Hello\!
M6090_S0010_G0500_300_resiman=I've only just been assigned here, so...yeah. Can't really tell you much about this place.
M6090_S0010_G0510_300_resiman=The abandoned factory is west of camp, and the desert is...northwest? Geez, I'm never gonna be able to remember all of this.
M6090_S0010_G0520_300_resiman=Make sure you get regular maintenance. Also, if you want an upgrade, you should talk to the woman out front.
M6090_S0010_G0530_300_resiman=YoRHa bodies are expensive, so don't go getting yourself hurt\!
M6090_S0010_G0540_300_resiman=I fixed the camp's transporter so that you can return to the Bunker. It's ready for you whenever.
M6090_S0010_G0550_300_resiman=I'd like to fix other transporters as well, but I can't so long as the machines are in the way.
M6090_S0010_G0560_300_resiwoman=I've been having this really weird feeling in my chest lately... I wonder what it could be.
M6090_S0010_G0570_300_resiwoman=I was told there was nothing wrong with my body, but I'm sure this isn't normal for androids.
M6090_S0010_G0580_300_resiman=My job is to look through the camp supplies and check our stock.
M6090_S0010_G0590_300_resiman=When supplies are low, providers from each area send us what we need and leave it for us to manage.
M6090_S0010_G0600_300_resiman=We've been doing lots of investigations lately, so I've been swamped.
M6090_S0010_G0610_300_resiwoman=Psst... Uh-huh.
M6090_S0010_G0620_300_resiwoman=...Hmm? You wanna know what I'm saying? Well, it's none of your beeswax\!
M6090_S0010_G0630_300_resiwoman=Psst... Yes? Oh my\!
M6090_S0010_G0640_300_resiwoman=...Hey\! No eavesdropping\!
M6090_S0010_G0650_300_resiman=Geez, who made this mess?
M6090_S0010_G0660_300_resiman=There's so much stuff here, it's hard to keep track of it all.
M6090_S0010_G0670_300_resiman=Ahhh... I can't wait to have a drink after work.
M6090_S0010_G0680_300_resiman=Humans used to have drinks and talk together after work. That's a tradition we should bring back\!
M6090_S0010_G0690_300_resiman=It must be tough having to spend every day of your life in combat.
M6090_S0010_G0700_300_resiman=No matter how hard you push yourself, what will be will be. So take it easy\!
M6090_S0010_G0710_300_resiwoman=Hiya\! Here to take a load off?
M6090_S0010_G0720_300_resiwoman=I'm always telling him he should rest sometimes, but he never listens.
M6090_S0010_G0730_300_resiwoman=As soon as he gets back from his investigations, he goes to help at the item shop. He takes on every little task, even if he's no good at it.
M6090_S0010_G0740_300_resiman=So this goes here... Ummm...
M6090_S0010_G0750_300_resiman=That's odd. Why isn't it moving?
M6090_S0010_G0760_300_resiman=I'm endlessly carrying things, day after day after day. I need a break\!
M6090_S0010_G0770_300_resiman=There's so much work, my colleagues are useless, my superiors are tyrants, and this war shows no signs of ending\!
M6090_S0010_G0780_300_resiman=It's just bad news everywhere you look.
M6090_S0010_G0790_300_resiman=All clear to the right\! All clear to the left\!\nNothing to report today\!
M6090_S0010_G0800_300_resiman=I'm taking care of the guard duties. I won't let even a single mouse get in.
M6090_S0020_G0110_300_resiman=Does it seem like the enemy's been more active lately? I hope it's just my imagination...
M6090_S0020_G0120_300_resiman=I'm secretly training so I can protect everyone when the time comes. But I still have a long way to go.
M6090_S0020_G0130_300_resiman=YoRHa soldiers are amazing. To think how you could destroy all those machines just like that\!
M6090_S0020_G0140_300_resiman=Let's be careful out there\! ...I probably don't need to tell you that, but hey, just in case.
M6090_S0020_G0150_300_resiman=You were really amazing with those Goliath units\! If you keep it up, this war will be over in no time\!
M6090_S0020_G0160_300_resiman=Make good use of the intelligence we gathered...
M6090_S0020_G0170_300_resiman=Intelligence gathering is dangerous, so many prefer to procure goods instead.
M6090_S0020_G0180_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0020_G0190_300_resiwoman=I'm busy recording information on the area that collapsed. You mind leaving me alone?
M6090_S0020_G0200_300_resiwoman=...
M6090_S0020_G0210_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0020_G0220_300_resiwoman=.........
M6090_S0020_G0230_300_resiwoman=Okay, RUDE\!
M6090_S0020_G0240_300_resiman=Our leader is tough, but that doesn't mean she doesn't worry. So don't go upsetting her, understand\!?
M6090_S0020_G0250_300_resiman=Make sure you replenish what you need. It's important to take care of yourself.
M6090_S0020_G0260_300_resiwoman=Strange things keep happening around here, but only in this little area. I'm worried. Very, very, very worried.
M6090_S0020_G0270_300_resiwoman=I went outside recently and got attacked by some of those dinky little machines—which aren't much compared to a Goliath, I know, but it still surprised me—but thankfully
M6090_S0020_G0280_300_resiwoman=I had a partner with me who managed to take 'em out, so I avoided serious injury. Thank goodness for friends, am I right sure I am friends are the
M6090_S0020_G0290_300_resiwoman=best I'm so grateful for all the—I'm doing it again, aren't I? I'm talking too much. Well, YOU started it, so let's keep the conversation going\!
M6090_S0020_G0300_300_a2b=......
M6090_S0020_G0310_300_a9s=......
M6090_S0020_G0320_300_resiwoman=Oh, you've come back\! I appreciate you coming here even though you're busy because everyone always ignores me since I talk so much but you always talk with
M6090_S0020_G0330_300_resiwoman=me which is really nice and hey you know who else is nice? Our leader\! She treated my wounds recently because I cut myself carrying some stuff which was dumb but
M6090_S0020_G0340_300_resiwoman=she was really worried especially because there was a LOT of blood but it wasn't as bad as it looked so I felt bad for scaring her like that and now
M6090_S0020_G0350_300_resiwoman=I always try to be careful but I'm often thoughtless which is bad even though androids can just be repaired and go back to normal but
M6090_S0020_G0360_300_resiwoman=our leader says I should be careful anyway before I really hurt myself and I know she's right but also think she worries too much.
M6090_S0020_G0370_300_a2b=......
M6090_S0020_G0380_300_a9s=......
M6090_S0020_G0390_300_resiwoman=Aren't you the YoRHa I keep hearing about? Everyone's talking about your successes.
M6090_S0020_G0400_300_resiwoman=If you ever feel low on energy, maybe take some of hers. It's exhausting just being around her\!
M6090_S0020_G0410_300_resiwoman=I've started taking notes recently. If I write things down on paper, I can remember the things I've forgotten.
M6090_S0020_G0420_300_resiwoman=But it's pretty scary to consider. I mean, when your memories disappear, you stop being yourself.
M6090_S0020_G0480_300_resiman=You're doing great\! And bit by bit, I feel like I'm getting used to this environment.
M6090_S0020_G0490_300_resiman=Okay, so north of the camp is the forest, and northeast is the machine village. ...Er, right?
M6090_S0020_G0500_300_resiman=Everyone's been so busy lately. I've been helping with maintenance when I can, but it's pretty tough\!
M6090_S0020_G0510_300_resiman=Aren't you tired? It's good you're trying your best, but don't overdo it.
M6090_S0020_G0520_300_resiman=I've been trying to repair the surrounding transporters, but the enemy keeps breaking them as soon as I finish.
M6090_S0020_G0530_300_resiman=There's no point in the vending machine camouflage anymore.
M6090_S0020_G0540_300_resiman=If you find any machines near a transporter, make them pay\!
M6090_S0020_G0550_300_resiwoman=You two always look so close. Honestly, I'm jealous.
M6090_S0020_G0560_300_resiwoman=It's a secret from the others, but there are some good machines out there...
M6090_S0020_G0570_300_resiwoman=I wish all the machines would just die already.
M6090_S0020_G0580_300_resiman=Hi there, YoRHa ace\! We're making sure we're equipped to support you to the utmost so you can fight at your best.
M6090_S0020_G0590_300_resiman=I'm working. ...Look, there they go\!
M6090_S0020_G0600_300_resiwoman=Psst... Oh, I see\!
M6090_S0020_G0610_300_resiwoman=...Hmm? You want me to tell you what we're talking about? Heck no\! I still don't know you well enough.
M6090_S0020_G0620_300_resiwoman=So anyway, I says to her...
M6090_S0020_G0630_300_resiwoman=Eavesdrop all you want. It's nothing important.
M6090_S0020_G0640_300_resiman=Um, let's move that to the box over there...
M6090_S0020_G0650_300_resiman=I'm happy we're trading with Pascal, but it's still a little weird swapping stuff with machines.
M6090_S0020_G0660_300_resiman=I found some old alcohol when the center of the city ruins was blown off, so I tried a little. It's really good\!
M6090_S0020_G0670_300_resiman=Don't tell my boss\!
M6090_S0020_G0680_300_resiman=Data processing must get worse when you drink. I feel so out of it, plus nothing seems to matter anymore.
M6090_S0020_G0690_300_resiman=It's like I'm in a dream.
M6090_S0020_G0700_300_resiman=I've been so busy lately that I haven't had a proper break. You've got to rest sometimes.
M6090_S0020_G0710_300_resiman=...What's that? I look like I'm always resting? Hey, mind your business\!
M6090_S0020_G0720_300_resiwoman=Make sure you take it easy, all right?
M6090_S0020_G0730_300_resiwoman=You always seem busy, but you've got to make time for your loved ones, too.
M6090_S0020_G0740_300_resiwoman=You're not going to be together forever... Not that you'll listen to someone like me, though.
M6090_S0020_G0750_300_resiman=So that goes in here...and connects to this...
M6090_S0020_G0760_300_resiman=Hmm... Why are there so many parts?
M6090_S0030_G0110_300_resiman=You're still alive?
M6090_S0030_G0120_300_resiman=We must survive at all costs. This is no time to be fainthearted\!
M6090_S0030_G0160_300_resiman=So much has happened recently. You must be exhausted\!
M6090_S0030_G0170_300_resiman=I'll carry out my work until the bitter end. Everything depends on it.
M6090_S0030_G0180_300_resiwoman=Psst... Uh-huh... You don't say\!
M6090_S0030_G0190_300_a2b=......
M6090_S0030_G0200_300_a9s=......
M6090_S0030_G0210_300_a2=Who you talking to?
M6090_S0030_G0220_300_resiwoman=It's rude to eavesdrop\!
M6090_S0030_G0230_300_resiman=Man, booze is the BEST\! ...Is it gone? Please tell me it's not all gone\!
M6090_S0030_G0240_300_resiman=...What? You gotta problem with me\!?
M6090_S0030_G0250_300_resiman=Why did I survive...?
M6090_S0030_G0260_300_resiman=I shouldn't have survived. It should've been someone better. Someone who took his job more seriously.
M6090_S0030_G0270_300_resiman=You think so too, don't you?
M6090_S0030_G0280_300_resiman=Even with things the way they are, I'm scared of fighting. I don't think I can even move.
M6090_S0030_G0290_300_resiman=I wish I could give up and stop caring.
M6090_S0080_G0000_300_resiwoman=Resistance Camp to bunker. I'm sending Earth data.
M6090_S0080_G0010_300_resiwoman=......
M6090_S0080_G0020_300_resiman=You again? What happened? Also, you should be more careful\!
M6090_S0080_G0030_300_resiman=Make sure you replenish what you need. You have to take care of yourself.
M6090_S0080_G0040_300_resiman=Another casualty?
M6090_S0080_G0050_300_resiman=...No? Well, that's a piece of good news\! We can only do simple repairs here.
M6090_S0080_G0060_300_resiman=There's no use saying don't push yourself too hard, but at least try to look after yourself.
M6090_S0080_G0070_300_resiman=Are you saving your data regularly? Even if you get a replacement body, you're as good as dead if your data's lost.
M6090_S0080_G0080_300_resiman=Have you been saving your data regularly? If not, do it before it's too late\!
M6090_S0080_G0090_300_resiwoman=I know these bodies are basically just shells, but it pains me to see them injured...
M6090_S0080_G0100_300_resiwoman=Are you injured? If not, then stay that way\! Don't do anything reckless, and make sure to get enough rest.
M6090_S0080_G0110_300_resiman=Why are you lazing around here? Your friends need you\!
M6090_S0080_G0120_300_resiman=There's not much we can do, but I'm relying on you\!
M6090_S0080_G0160_300_resiman=What happened\!? ...Oh, and don't worry—I'm protecting this place.
M6090_S0080_G0170_300_resiman=This is all we can do. At the very least, we've got to push on.
M6090_S0080_G0180_300_resiman=Why are you here? Are we...under attack\!?\nOh no\! I've got to carry out the supplies right away\!
M6090_S0080_G0190_300_resiman=...Oh, we're not? Geez, don't scare me like that\!
M6090_S0080_G0200_300_resiman=Everyone's depending on these supplies. I must protect them with my life\!
