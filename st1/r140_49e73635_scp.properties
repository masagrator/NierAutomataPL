M5800_S0010_G0100_001_robomother=Get this door open and drag my good-for-nothing son out here this instant\!
M5800_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=...Damn. That lock's stronger than I thought.
M5802_S0010_G0000_001_robomother=Hello, my android friend. I can't believe I have to say this, but it seems my son has locked hims—
M5802_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=AGAIN\!?
M5802_S0010_G0020_001_robomother=He was doing so well\! He even talked to that girl he liked\! But yesterday, he had some sort of relapse.
M5802_S0010_G0030_001_robomother=I'm so ashamed to be in this position, but would you mind helping me one more time?
M5802_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Help the mother.
M5802_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Refuse.
M5802_S0010_G0060_001_robomother=I understand. You must be so tired of coming to my rescue like this.
M5802_S0010_G0070_001_robomother=Will you please help my son? He's locked himself inside yet again.
M5802_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=Fine, whatever.
M5802_S0010_G0100_001_robochild=Hee hee\! You're going to love this one\!
M5802_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=You shouldn't be proud of hiding from the world\! Besides, I thought you had a girlfriend.
M5802_S0010_G0120_001_robochild=Maaaaaybe. But I'll tell you if you get my lock open\!
M5802_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=This is so stupid...
M5802_S0010_G0140_001_robochild=You win\!
M5802_S0010_G0150_001_robomother=Do you even know how much trouble you've caused for everyone, young man? ...Well\!? Do you\!?
M5802_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=Okay kid, spill it. What's your deal?
M5802_S0010_G0170_001_robochild=I've been trying, okay?
M5802_S0010_G0180_001_robochild=I went out and talked to everyone I saw. I even talked to the girl I liked\! It was...fun.
M5802_S0010_G0190_001_robochild=But then it got hard, 'cause you can't just talk to people, you know? You have to read between the lines and stuff.
M5802_S0010_G0200_001_robochild=So I kinda decided that staying inside was way easier.
M5802_S0010_G0210_001_robochild=But I have a dream now—I'm gonna be the best shut-in I can possibly be\!
M5802_S0010_G0220_001_robochild=Next time, I'm gonna make a lock you won't be able to break in a bajillion quintillion years\!
M5802_S0010_G0230_001_robomother=Will you listen to my darling boy? He has a goal now\! How wonderful\!
M5802_S0010_G0240_001_robomother=And it's all thanks to you\!
M5802_S0010_G0250_001_a9s=D-don't mention it...
M5802_S0010_G0260_001_a9s=Why do I have the feeling we're back to square one?
