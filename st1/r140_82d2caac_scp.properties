M1040_S0030_G0020_001_n02=Stop\! Do not kill\!
M1040_S0030_G0030_001_n02=No fighting\! No fighting\!
M1040_S0030_G0040_001_n02=Don't kill\! Don't kill\!
M1040_S0030_G0050_001_n02=We have done nothing bad\!
M1040_S0030_G0060_001_n02=I'm sorry\! I'm sorry\!
M5040_S0010_G0145_001_papa=Please, we beg of you. Save him...
M5110_S0010_G0005_300_sister=I heard my sister was...found in the desert.
M5110_S0010_G0006_300_sister=I can't believe she's no longer functioning while I'm still here...
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=This is sooo fuuuun\!
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5520_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=Superb\! Thank you for this valuable information.
M5520_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=Please take this as a reward.
M5803_S0010_G0010_001_robomother=Rrrrgh\! What am I supposed to DO\!?
M6050_S0010_G0230_300_villager=Ah, <SARU_JAN>...
M6050_S0010_G0550_300_villager=There is no meaning in war.
M6050_S0010_G0560_300_villager=<SARU_JAN>'s right.
M6050_S0010_G1270_300_villager=A while ago, I heard a terrible noise coming from the city ruins.
M6050_S0010_G1280_300_villager=But wh-whatever happens, I'll protect the village\!
M6050_S0010_G1290_300_villager=I s-sure wish my shift would end already...
M6050_S0010_G1300_300_villager=We're safe here\! I think. Maybe.
M6050_S0010_G1310_300_villager=I heard a loud noise in the distance.
M6050_S0010_G1320_300_villager=Are you okay?
M6050_S0010_G1330_300_villager=Make yourself at home\!
M6050_S0010_G1340_300_kj=That was some earthquake. Are you all right?
M6050_S0010_G1350_300_kj=I've been told that providing is preventing. So buy whatever you like\!
M6050_S0010_G1360_300_kj=I hope that guy in the forest is okay.
M6050_S0010_G1370_300_kj=Come see me any time.
M6050_S0010_G1380_300_sp=It's good to see you in one piece. I was worried I'd lost a valuable customer.
M6050_S0010_G1390_300_sp=Are you looking for something?
M6050_S0010_G1400_300_sp=Come back and see me anytime.
M6050_S0010_G1430_300_villager=The earthquake really caught me off guard\! I actually dropped one of my torsos.
M6050_S0010_G1440_300_villager=Dear me... Where could it have gone?
M6050_S0010_G1450_300_villager=Hey, look at this torso I found lying on the ground\!
M6050_S0010_G1460_300_villager=Heh heh. How cool does this make me look\!?
M6050_S0010_G1470_300_villager=It's not enough\! I want more\!
M6050_S0010_G1480_300_villager=There was a huge noise before, so I came here to see what's going on.
M6050_S0010_G1490_300_villager=I hope the forest creatures are okay.
M6050_S0010_G1500_300_villager=Facing dangers on your own makes you strong.
M6050_S0010_G1510_300_villager=A solitary man is a true soldier\!
M6050_S0010_G1520_300_villager=But feel free to drop by whenever you want, okay?
M6050_S0010_G1530_300_pascal=Say, are you all right? There was a huge earthquake, so I was worried.
M6050_S0010_G1540_300_pascal=I'm glad you and the villagers are all okay.
M6050_S0010_G1550_300_villager=I know there's not much to do here, but consider yourself at home.
M6050_S0010_G1560_300_villager=I heard a really loud BOOOOOM\! It was scary, but also kinda exciting.
M6050_S0010_G1570_300_villager=What should we play next?
M6050_S0010_G1580_300_villager=Everything was shaking so much\! It was so loud\!
M6050_S0010_G1590_300_villager=I should probably be more careful while playing from now on.
M6050_S0010_G1600_300_villager=Wow, that was a HUGE earthquake\!
M6050_S0010_G1610_300_villager=Are you okay? 'Cause I'm okay\! I don't go down that easily\!
M6050_S0010_G1650_300_villager=In my house, everything's within arm's reach.
M6050_S0010_G1660_300_villager=It's a comfortable life. I have everything I need.
M6050_S0010_G1670_300_villager=I don't need a house.
M6050_S0010_G1680_300_villager=Sure, sometimes it would be nice to be warm and cozy, but out here I'm always free.
M6050_S0010_G1690_300_villager=I heard an explosion in the distance. Are you okay?
M6050_S0010_G1700_300_villager=Stay out of trouble\!
M6050_S0010_G1770_300_villager=Hmmm...
M6050_S0010_G1780_300_villager=I'm trying to think of games we can play with their stubby little legs...
M6050_S0010_G1790_300_villager=Maybe we should just settle for tag.
M6050_S0010_G1800_300_villager=Yeah, tag's not bad.
M6050_S0010_G1810_300_villager=Just because I'm big doesn't mean I'm strong...
M6050_S0010_G1820_300_villager=I wish I was as big as him\!
M6050_S0010_G1830_300_villager=O, powers that be\! Grant me a bigger body\!
M6050_S0010_G2600_300_papa=This is bad. This is really bad...
M6050_S0010_G2930_300_villager=Welcome to our village\!
M6050_S0010_G2960_300_villager=Hello. Nice day we're having\!
M6050_S0010_G2970_300_villager=Let me know if I can help you with anything.
M6050_S0010_G3070_300_villager=I think I've had my fill of this place. I'd like to go somewhere else, but my carrier isn't showing up.
M6050_S0010_G3080_300_villager=He just doesn't seem to care about punctuality at all\! Or perhaps he's angry I keep asking him to carry me everywhere...
M6050_S0010_G3090_300_villager=I'm so tired from carrying my friend. I just need a little rest.
