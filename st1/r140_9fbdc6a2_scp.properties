M5040_S0010_G0000_300_papa=My son told me how you helped him. Thank you.
M5040_S0010_G0010_300_papa=I fear this is in no small part my fault, for I put all the burden of raising him on my wife.
M5040_S0010_G0020_300_papa=You certainly did\!
M5040_S0010_G0030_300_papa=I'm sorry, dear.

M5040_S0010_G0070_300_papa=Yeah\! Learned your lesson\!
M5040_S0010_G0080_300_papa=I was hoping one of you would take my side...
M5040_S0010_G0090_300_papa=I suppose I should try to be more of a "family man," as they say.
M5040_S0010_G0100_300_papa=But what does that entail, exactly...?
M5040_S0010_G0110_300_papa=Thank you for saving my son.
M5040_S0010_G0120_300_papa=I feel like I understand him better than before.
M5040_S0010_G0130_300_papa=I know that raising a child is never easy, but I feel it's worth the struggle.
M5040_S0010_G0140_300_child=Hey\! Thanks for before\!
M5040_S0010_G0150_300_child=I'm a really good boy now. I listen to EVERYTHING Mommy says\!
