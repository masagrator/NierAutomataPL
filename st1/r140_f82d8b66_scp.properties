M1040_S0030_G0020_001_n02=Stop\! Do not kill\!
M1040_S0030_G0030_001_n02=No fighting\! No fighting\!
M1040_S0030_G0040_001_n02=Don't kill\! Don't kill\!
M1040_S0030_G0050_001_n02=We have done nothing bad\!
M1040_S0030_G0060_001_n02=I'm sorry\! I'm sorry\!
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=This is sooo fuuuun\!
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5803_S0010_G0010_001_robomother=Rrrrgh\! What am I supposed to DO\!?
M6050_S0010_G0100_300_villager=This is our village. I keep it safe.
M6050_S0010_G0110_300_villager=I'm ready to change shifts.
M6050_S0010_G0120_300_villager=Welcome to our village...
M6050_S0010_G0130_300_villager=Er, make yourself at home...
M6050_S0010_G0140_300_kj=Welcome\! Even though none of the villagers want to fight, I have weapons here just in case.
M6050_S0010_G0150_300_kj=Care to take a look?
M6050_S0010_G0160_300_kj=Back again? Feel free to look around.
M6050_S0010_G0170_300_kj=I learned how to make weapons from a legendary swordsmith in the forest.
M6050_S0010_G0180_300_kj=I wish he'd come to the village...
M6050_S0010_G0190_300_kj=I love peace, but I also love weapons. ...I guess that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
M6050_S0010_G0200_300_kj=Come back any time you like.
M6050_S0010_G0210_300_sp=Welcome. Are you looking for anything?
M6050_S0010_G0220_300_sp=Come back whenever you like. No need to be shy.
M6050_S0010_G0230_300_villager=Ah, <SARU_JAN>...
M6050_S0010_G0240_300_villager=What's so amazing about this <SARU_JAN> guy?
M6050_S0010_G0250_300_villager=I don't get what's so special about this <SARU_JAN> fellow at all.
M6050_S0010_G0260_300_villager=Look at him and his three-tier belly\! That's so cool\!
M6050_S0010_G0270_300_villager=I want to add more tiers to my belly...
M6050_S0010_G0280_300_villager=I'm standing watch to prevent miscreants from entering the village\!
M6050_S0010_G0290_300_villager=This path leads to the Forest Castle.
M6050_S0010_G0310_300_villager=I love this place. It's so quiet.
M6050_S0010_G0320_300_villager=Solitude makes you stronger.
M6050_S0010_G0330_300_villager=It's important for people to have time to themselves, don't you think?
M6050_S0010_G0340_300_villager=I'm not sure if machines count as "people," however.
M6050_S0010_G0350_300_villager=Just to be clear, I'm not standing here by myself because I don't have any friends.
M6050_S0010_G0360_300_pascal=The villagers here are all gentle and peace-loving.
M6050_S0010_G0370_300_pascal=I love watching the children play. They're so full of energy\!
M6050_S0010_G0380_300_villager=Uncle Pascal\! Let's play\!
M6050_S0010_G0390_300_villager=Come play with us\!
M6050_S0010_G0400_300_villager=Okay, but after we're done, you have to study.
M6050_S0010_G0410_300_villager=Do you promise?
M6050_S0010_G0420_300_villager=Okay\! I'll study later\!
M6050_S0010_G0430_300_villager=Yeah\! We'll study later\!
M6050_S0010_G0440_300_villager=So what do you wanna do?
M6050_S0010_G0450_300_villager=Ummm...I dunno. I didn't think that far ahead.
M6050_S0010_G0460_300_villager=Playing is kind of like studying in a way.
M6050_S0010_G0470_300_villager=Don't you think?
M6050_S0010_G0480_300_villager=I can play on my own. I'm all grown up\!
M6050_S0010_G0490_300_villager=Listen to them. It's all "Uncle Pascal this" and "Uncle Pascal that." What a bunch of babies\!
M6050_S0010_G0500_300_villager=What? Do you...want to play with me?
M6050_S0010_G0510_300_villager=Well, if you reeeeeally want to, I guess I'll do you a favor. But just this once\!
M6050_S0010_G0550_300_villager=There is no meaning in war.
M6050_S0010_G0560_300_villager=<SARU_JAN>'s right.
M6050_S0010_G0570_300_villager=I like staying inside.
M6050_S0010_G0580_300_villager=I love lazing about the house and enjoying the view.
M6050_S0010_G0590_300_villager=I love being outside so much\!
M6050_S0010_G0600_300_villager=Flying through the forest... Listening to the leaves rustle...
M6050_S0010_G0610_300_villager=I guess you'd only really understand if you could fly.
M6050_S0010_G0620_300_villager=The view from the sky is awesome\!
M6050_S0010_G0630_300_villager=Ahhhhh... I love hanging out in high places\!
M6050_S0010_G0640_300_villager=Do you like heights too? The view from here is incredible\!
M6050_S0010_G0650_300_villager=I'd love to go to that castle in the forest, but Pascal said it's too dangerous.
M6050_S0010_G0660_300_villager=Pascal made this slide just for us\!
M6050_S0010_G0670_300_villager=I love it so much\! It's an addiction\!
M6050_S0010_G0680_300_villager=So this is that "slide" I keep hearing so much about, eh?
M6050_S0010_G0690_300_villager=It's quite...fascinating.
M6050_S0010_G0700_300_villager=I'll just look at it a bit more...from a safe distance.
M6050_S0010_G0710_300_villager=N-not that I'm scared or anything\!
M6050_S0010_G0780_300_villager=What should we do today?
M6050_S0010_G0790_300_villager=Play tag\!
M6050_S0010_G0800_300_villager=Um...um...jump rope\!
M6050_S0010_G0810_300_villager=Jump rope? I wanna jump rope\!
M6050_S0010_G0820_300_villager=I hope my legs are long enough...
M6050_S0010_G0830_300_villager=......
M6050_S0010_G0840_300_villager=Life is hard.
M6050_S0010_G0850_300_villager=Soooo...tag then?
M6050_S0010_G0860_300_villager=I wanna jump rope...
M6050_S0010_G0870_300_villager=My body is big, but I feel tiny on the inside.
M6050_S0010_G0880_300_villager=Please don't make fun of me.
M6050_S0010_G0881_300_villager=I want to be as big as this guy.
M6050_S0010_G0882_300_villager=I wish I was bigger. Don't you?
M6050_S0010_G0883_300_villager=Strength... I need more strength\!
M6050_S0010_G0884_300_villager=If I was huge, I could destroy everything\!
M6050_S0010_G2600_300_papa=This is bad. This is really bad...
M6050_S0010_G2930_300_villager=Welcome to our village\!
M6050_S0010_G2960_300_villager=Hello. Nice day we're having\!
M6050_S0010_G2970_300_villager=Let me know if I can help you with anything.
M6050_S0010_G3030_300_villager=Today, I want you to take me to the top of the village, the Forest Castle, and Pascal's place\!
M6050_S0010_G3040_300_villager=After that, we can go to the village entrance and the bridge to the amusement park\!
M6050_S0010_G3050_300_villager=This guy can't climb very well, so I have to carry him to high places. I also have to carry him while playing, so my arms are getting pretty tired.
M6050_S0010_G3060_300_villager=I'm going to get Pascal to teach him the word "restraint" next time.
