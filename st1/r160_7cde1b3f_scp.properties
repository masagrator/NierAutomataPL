M6080_S0100_G0010_300_kj=I am the blacksmith Masamune.
M6080_S0100_G0020_300_kj=I see you're taking good care of your weapons.
M6080_S0100_G0030_300_kj=However, I'd be happy to sharpen them for you if you wish.
M6080_S0100_G0040_300_kj=Ah\! Your white sword\!
M6080_S0100_G0050_300_kj=My master honed that very blade long ago.
M6080_S0100_G0060_300_kj=He was a master craftsman who gathered four black and four white weapons and improved on them.
M6080_S0100_G0070_300_kj=But they spilled so much blood that my master sealed them away in various locations across the world.
M6080_S0100_G0080_300_kj=However, I wager you would wield them in the service of good. If that is true, you can search for them in sealed shrines throughout the world.
M6080_S0110_G0010_300_kj=Have you any weapons you wish for me to sharpen?
M6080_S0110_G0020_300_kj=Weapons are mirrors that reflect what is in your heart. Treat them with the care they deserve.
M6080_S0120_G0010_300_kj=Hmm... It has been long and long since I've seen someone take such good care of a weapon. Please take this as a token of my appreciation.
M6080_S0120_G0020_300_kj=This is one of the weapons I was telling you about. It was passed down through the generations until it came to me, and I can't bring myself to seal it away.
M6080_S0120_G0030_300_kj=But I know you will give it the respect it craves.
