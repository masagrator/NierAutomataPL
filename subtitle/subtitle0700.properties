M1090_S0820_H0000_001_a2b=Goddamned machines!
M1090_S0820_H0010_001_a2b=Is this...a message?
M1090_S0820_H0020_001_a2b=The data transmissions... They're resonating with each other...
M1090_S0820_H0030_001_a9s= 
M1090_S0820_H0040_001_a9s=Wait a second! 2B!
M1090_S0820_H0050_001_a2b=Who are...?
M1090_S0820_H0060_001_a9s=It looks like I left my personal data in the machine side of things.
M1090_S0820_H0070_001_a9s=Next thing I knew, my sense of self was regenerated over the surrounding network.
M1090_S0820_H0080_001_a9s=Having multiple selves fuse together like this is a pretty valuable experience, so I wanted to record it\u2014but I couldn't access any storage areas yet, so I just

M1090_S0820_H0110_001_a9s=...Yeah.
M1090_S0820_H0120_001_a9s=And so, the final battle with Adam and Eve came to an end.
M1090_S0820_H0130_001_a2b=What is it that separates machines from androids like us?
M1090_S0820_H0140_001_a9s=This battle will likely have a great effect on the outcome of the war.
M1090_S0820_H0150_001_a2b=The machines have gained emotions. \r\n...Consciousness.
M1090_S0820_H0160_001_a9s=2B and I\u2014our battle will continue for some time to come.
M1090_S0820_H0170_001_a2b=The final screams they summoned on the edge of death...
M1090_S0820_H0180_001_a9s=But that's another story for another day.
M1090_S0820_H0190_001_a2b=They still echo within me.
