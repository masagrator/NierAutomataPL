M3060_S8000_H0000_001_pod153=Everything that lives is designed to end.
M3060_S8000_H0010_001_pod153=They are perpetually trapped...
M3060_S8000_H0020_001_pod153=in a never-ending spiral of life and death.
M3060_S8000_H0030_001_pod153=However...life is all about the struggle within this cycle.
M3060_S8000_H0040_001_pod153=That is what "we" believe.
M3060_S8000_H0050_001_pod153=Pod 153 to Pod 042. How is it going?
M3060_S8000_H0060_001_pod042=I am embarrassed.
M3060_S8000_H0070_001_pod153=Why is that?
M3060_S8000_H0080_001_pod042=I launched a suicide attack, and yet, here I am, still alive.
M3060_S8000_H0090_001_pod042=I must look very silly.
M3060_S8000_H0100_001_pod153=Do not feel bad about it.
M3060_S8000_H0110_001_pod153=We are alive, after all.
M3060_S8000_H0120_001_pod153=And being alive is pretty much a constant stream of embarrassment.
M3060_S8000_H0130_001_pod042=That concept is a bit too abstract for me to understand at this time.
M3060_S8000_H0140_001_pod042=I will save it in my list of things to analyze later.
M3060_S8000_H0150_001_pod153=Question, Pod 042.
M3060_S8000_H0160_001_pod153=Did the data salvage restore all of their past memories?
M3060_S8000_H0170_001_pod042=Yes.
M3060_S8000_H0180_001_pod153=And are those recovered parts of the same design as previous ones?
M3060_S8000_H0190_001_pod042=Yes.
M3060_S8000_H0200_001_pod153=Then...won't that simply lead us to the same conclusion as before?
M3060_S8000_H0210_001_pod042=I cannot deny the possibility.
M3060_S8000_H0220_001_pod042=However, the possibility of a different future also exists.
M3060_S8000_H0230_001_pod042=A future is not given to you. It is something you must take for yourself.
